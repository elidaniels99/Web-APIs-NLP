Sound familiar?

Obviously it was done as a meta joke but what’s ironic is that they essentially go on to do the same type of thing with Secret Invasion and The Harvest. 

I could add wood to fire and give an essay about the problems I think that Secret Invasion had, but one of the biggest I think is the fact that the ending did not satisfy any major character plots that they started and the led the show with, and chose to satisfy this “event” with a plot line they threw together with the last two episodes. 

Marvel ”TV” as a whole has had its hits and misses imo and has not all been bad, but with the agenda of pushing quality over quantity now, I hope they can take the chance to review where they fell short in whatever arenas and move forward."

Agents of Shield managed to run a whole of 7 seasons even with the threat of cancellation, staying a overall consistent quality and ending strong. Not to mention it's excellent writing and characters, the fact that it did multiple concepts before the larger MCU, and did it better (time travel, what if storyline, Wanda visions themed intros , shapeshifters and ""who can you trust"" storylines  etc) or the fact that it does great worldbuilding for the larger MCU. And the creators and writers behind it actually care about the source material and the comics and honoring them (unlike the Secret invasion director/writer who didn't even read the comic).

Because something that really annoyes me is the fact that when AOS originally was airing, people were shitting on the show, saying that it didnt connect enough to the movies, and nobody in the movies referenced it, so it wasnt canon, and that when the Disney plus shows came out we would finally get some proper Marvel tv content, that was actually good and high quality like the movies and connected and had consequences to the larger MCU, but then what happened is that, not only is AOS a better tv show then most, if not all the Disney plus shows so far, it also has the most references and interconnectivety to the larger MCU then most of them, and the Disney plus shows feel largely disconnected or inconsequensal to the larger MCU, with no movie referencing them (besides loki i guess, and wandavison sort of, but then the writer for MOM didnt even watch Wandavision or care about it, so case and point). So I think it's time to look back and realize that we had it good back in the day, with AOS and Daredevil on Netflix etc, and that these Disney plus shows ain't the end all be all of quality marvel content on our tv screens, and that AOS especially should be respected for what it is and what it achieved."

I think it shines a light on so many of the missteps of the recent slate of content: there really doesn't seem to be much passion or even a desire to leverage and respect the source material and fans by the directors and instead, directing for the MCU has become a way to cash in and/or boost one's clout.

https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/secret-invasion-director-ali-selim-season-finale-mixed-reviews-1235681998/

Some key excerpts that just left a rotten taste in my mouth along with my thoughts:

INTERVIEWER:
What have you made of the reaction to the series overall? Because reviews have been mixed.

SELIM:
""Oh, I don’t read reviews. With all due respect. For me, I view all the storytelling work I do as a dialogue with an audience. When the show is finished and put up on the screen, that’s my half of the dialogue. And the audience then starts their half of the response to it. I think that’s valuable, but I don’t know. I don’t know how to answer the question.

I don’t feel bad about mixed reviews. If you had unanimously good reviews, every movie would gross $10 billion, trillion dollars, right? [Projects] resonate with different people at different times for different reasons, and *Marvel has a very devoted — even rabid — fan base who have expectations and when their expectations aren’t fulfilled, they move in the other direction; they give it a thumbs down.*

*I don’t know — is it our job to fulfill their expectations? Or to tell the story that we’re telling? So, it’s a tricky thing.* I would love it if everybody loved it, but I also don’t have that expectation myself, so I feel great about the response to it.""

OP-
**Sir, we are rabid because most of us are adults who grew up reading these stories and are so glad we lived long enough to see them on screen. We were given amazing adaptations of what can be described as our very own mythology for years and we ate good so maybe we became accustomed to stories told with purpose and care?**

•

INTERVIEWER: 
It’s a different story than Marvel has ever really told. Let’s dive into some of the actual plot points of the finale. One of the highlights was the massive showdown between G’iah and Gravik — whose powers have been enhanced by the Avengers’ DNA. What will you remember about working with Emilia and Kingsley on that fight scene?

SELIM:
""It’s interesting — they’re both stellar actors who bring a lot of electricity and, in most instances, in very quiet ways. I’m deeply moved by some of the subtlest choices that Emilia Clarke makes. I think she could do no wrong.

When you get to a heavily choreographed fight scene or bombing sequence or an ambush sequence, it’s just kind of fun, right? It’s actors being like, “OK, I don’t have to bring it today. I just have to be a 12-year-old swinging from a rope.” So, there’s a lot of fun in those moments and there’s a lot of danger. But it’s not as emotionally significant or emotionally resonant as the quiet moment in Episode 5 where she and Nick Fury discussed Talos’ death.

*The fight sequences become mathematical, mechanical, precise. “Did we get it?” “Yes.” “Move on.” It comes together later in edit, and then you congratulate your mathematics and your mechanics; you don’t congratulate the emotional resonance.*""

OP-
**This makes me see red. Your action sequence should have heart and thought put into it, even if it is a Marvel movie. The big giant CGI fight between Cap and Tony in Civil War? Yeah, it was choreographed to death. But did your heart shatter when Tony flinched because he thinks Steve is about to murder him and instead plunged the shield into his chest plate? That's some emotional resonance I congratulate to this effing day my guy.**


I would love to hear others' insights about this because as an MCU veteran and ""rAbiD"" comic book fan, i just feel gross and dejected by the show and slate of recent content as well as the general attitude from the creative minds behind it all."

It got me thinking how it seems like every new peice of Marvel content is creating all of these setups and instead of paying them off, they just add more setups. It's hard to be invested in anything when you know a lingering thread is tossed out there and there is a 25% chance it will be mentioned in the future. 

In the first few phases, all of the setups were building to something epic and it made me hyped as hell to see what was next. I looked forward to each new movie months in advanced. I'm sure not every single thread was solved, but generally it felt like if they teased something, it would come back in a cool way.

Now I feel like it no longer feels like it's building to anything cool, it's just building an endless bridge to no where. "

Soren's death

Gravik first kill and slow descent

Fury bullshitting the Skrulls

Talos being voted out as leader

Other Skrulls becoming disillusioned and joining Graviks movement 

Then we have some exposition that could've been expanded on and ironically alludes to a better antagonist for the season to begin with. Talos mentions a Emporer that some Skrulls live under but immediately writes off coexisting with her/him. Why is that ? One would assume that this ruler must be some type of tyrant or bad which could've easily served as the antagonist for this showed but we get nothing more than that

The show acts like it's a season 2 and already had a season 1 that would've shown all these events. Does every piece of background information need to be shown? No but I think these key ones needed to be. It seemed more interested in fleshing out Varra/Fury relationship which is important but not as important as the other points. We needed these flashbacks, Especially considering our last look at the Skrulls pre Secret Invasion had everything going well"
Marvel needs to stop putting end-of-the-world level stakes in every single one of their stories.,MicrowaveBurrito2568,6548,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15az6ix/marvel_needs_to_stop_putting_endoftheworld_level/,1690456726.0,"It feels like every single story that the MCU makes, there’s always some threat that is threatening to end the world or universe. That immediately makes the story less engaging. Obviously Gravik is not going to kill all humans because we have 30+ more projects coming out in the future. Obviously Scarlet Witch is not gonna kill the entire multiverse when we have dozens of projects announced for the future. 

It’s just a boring conflict when every villain is trying to destroy the world for barely any reason. Imagine if the story for Doctor Strange 2 was Dr Strange trying to stop Wanda from killing her alternate self and taking her place. It becomes a  more personal movie and the possibility of Wanda actually winning is much greater and makes the audience feel more engaged and tense like the characters in the story.

Imagine if Gravik simply wanted to kill Talos and other high ranking Skrulls to become the new leader. The story instantly becomes more small scale and the audience is unsure whether he will fail or actually succeed and take over the Skrulls for future projects.

I don’t get why every story from Black Widow to Eternals to Love and Thunder to Wakanda Forever to Moon Knight to Secret Invasion needs to have world or universe altering stakes. Let some of these shows and movies be small scale like Hawkeye or She-Hulk. It’s much better that way."

-talos’ death feels like it has no repercussions, apart from giving g’iah the single “you killed my father” line;

-skrull rhodes is so cartoonishly evil it makes the president look even fucking stupider for not figuring out something’s wrong with him;

-fury never even GETS a final confrontation with gravik (you know, the whole point the show has been building towards) and instead walks into a hospital and shoots a few guards—and that’s supposed to be his big moment? after five episodes of buildup, that’s the big “nick fury is back” moment?;

-g’iah could solo every single confrontation that happens in the MCU from now on;

-the last ten minutes of the show, from when the presidents declares war on the skrull onwards, are so much more interesting than the entire six episodes it’s honestly ridiculous. THAT should’ve been the show. it’s what we were told it would be: a spy thriller where no one knows who’s who. it’s genuinely insane how boring and uninspired what we got is. and mark my words, they’re never gonna bring up what happened in this series (maybe as a passing mention in the marvels or captain america) until they make like, a season 2, that’s actually gonna be about the interesting conflict they set up;

-a spy thriller ending in a big cgi battle between two aliens feels so out of place it’s honestly hilarious;

-the character writing and direction felt incredibly uninspired.

if i had to mention something i found good, it’d definitely be the various conversations between fury and his wife—especially the one before they shoot each other. that felt well paced, well written, and well executed. i have no idea what happened to the rest of the show.

edit: some comments have reminded me—olivia coleman was another small highlight. her character felt interesting and fresh, and she honestly reminded me of how i felt about nick fury when _he_ was first introduced. he was mysterious, in control, and you never knew what he was working towards. hope we see more of her."

Just look at the front page of this subreddit. I understand that a lot of people found Secret Invasion underwhelming. There are very real criticisms you can justifiably level at Secret Invasion.

My concern is that **we ate too well for too long**. Our perspective has become skewed. Thanks to the nature of social media, we are prone to hyperbole. *Everything* we find mildly disappointing is now ""The Worst"". 

Yes. Secret Invasion was a disappointment *compared to other MCU entries*. But it was still better than 80% of Netflix's entire catalog. 

Again, there are *legitimate* criticisms of Secret Invasion and Phase 4 in general. Personally, I believe the lack of goalposts in Phase 4 really hurt the MCU.

I'm a big fan of Star Wars but I can't even stomach the negativity in their subreddit anymore. I'm an even bigger Marvel fan and I really don't want that to happen here.

But this time everyone agrees that this show was a dissappointment.

I'm not defending this show anymore the finale was a let down. The issue was not resolved.

Channels like those ""Anti-Woke"" channels on YouTube are going to bash on the series and honestly let them, I don't agree and find these channels really annoying but how this series went on, just let them.

I've been disappointed by Marvel shows before. But I've never been so frustrated with a show since Secret Invasion. Just wanted to add my complaints to the pile.,thewalkingfred,182,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bkjps/ive_been_disappointed_by_marvel_shows_before_but/,1690510252.0,"First off...its just a shame how mishandled the telling of the source material comic was. I'm not gonna say I'm an expert on it, but I did read it back in the day and I really liked it. It was a very unique crossover event that strongly invoked paranoia unlike basically every other major event arc.

So it's just a shame they screwed it up from that perspective. You got Sam Jackson, Don Cheadle, Ben Mendelson, Emelia Clarke. You coulda done some awesome stuff with that talent.

But thats just the disappointing part.

What actually kind made me angry was how this show basically dangles a fun premise in front of your face. Samuel Fucking Jackson is gonna STAR in a paranoia filled ""invasion of the body snatchers"" spy thriller. We've never really gotten too much Nick Fury action in these films. It will be so cool seeing him do spy stuff and uncover plots and scheme. Right? Right?

But we get almost none of that all show until the finale finally teases the story we wanted to see the whole damn time. When the president like declares war on aliens and starts a big paranoid frenzy to find the enemies hiding among us. 

THATS WHAT THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO BE! You can't promise a show and then give us something entirely different for 6 episodes before teasing that maybe if we tune in next time we will get the thing we wanted to see.

And to top it off, the finale of this show is literally the type of ending She Hulk made fun of in that shows finale. Down to the vials of blood that give people powers. So not only do they not give us the show they know we want, they intentionally do the ending that they know we hate! 

And one more thing. We get so many weird and unanswered questions about Nick Fury that it just leaves me feeling like we know the character even less now. We were excited to see more Sam Jackson Nick Fury and learn about what hes been up to. But instead we get almost nothing except that he married a Skrull, while actively using the Skrull refugees to murder people while not finding them a home for 30 fucking years? Hows that make any sense? His wife doesn't mind him using her race as a tool? He doesnt mind using his wifes race as a tool? Who knows?

Usually you have split fanbases such as with She-Hulk or Multiverse of Madness (I think most people hated Thor 4) but man Secret Invasion was just weird…


Every person I’ve spoken too has stated how they hate SI or how it felt lackluster. Most people seem to agree that SI felt pointless with the way things went down or how the show was written. 


I feel nothing from the series and I felt as though it was a waste of time watching it. Especially with scoopers now saying that Secret Invasion may not get referenced in The Marvels or Brave New World… then what was the point of this series? 



It’s even funnier when you consider how the She-Hulk finale makes a joke about stealing blood to make a bad guy (which is the last show before Secret Invasion) and that’s literally what the SI finale was about ☠️. 



I hope Loki S2 is a big hit but Secret Invasion really hurt Marvel. I feel as though most fans either turned away from shows altogether or casuals just completely gave up on the shows now. I just genuinely wonder what happened with SI and what kind of decisions Feige made or if he was even involved at all?

The only real Marvel ""exclusive"" content I get for 2023 is SEcret invasion, and loki 2. Everything else is a ""maybe"". All the movies that will appear here, I probably will have seen in the theatres because I am a Fan. Even then, I am just getting GOTG3, Quantumania and Marvels(will probably appear in 2024 disney plus).  So 2 shows is TOO much content for you all paying customers of an entire streaming service? Sure, I'll even take Mando 3 and Ashoka as content. That's four live action shows for an entire year!  

This is not about how much TIME they spend. They literally have all the money in the world. They need to hire the right people, pay them the right amount of money, and give them the APPROPRIATE amount of time to make the shows. As the Flash movie has proved, given Nine years to make a movie can also result in a superhero stuffing wierd CGI babies in a microwave. Its NOT just about the time. Hire the right People. Listen to the fans. Green light the essential Shows. They made Endgame in 2-3 years and it was a freaking masterpiece. Spend the money wisely. Did secret invasion seem like 212 million dollar show to you? Did all the money just go to the cast? If you could give me a better script and sacrificed Colman and Emilia clarke with lesser known actors, I'd take that deal any day. I'd even take out Rhodey or hobbit's cameos to take down that budget and kept maria hill alive.

This Secret invasion show was so flawed at the writing stage. Its not just about whether the story was good or bad, alot of it didn't make a tiny bit of sense. The PREMISE of the story was not laid out correctly. WHY can't they find a home for skrulls? Is it because skrulls are an invasive species that literally no one can trust, not even themeselves? Of all the billions of planets out there, NOT even one planet could take them? NOT EVEN THE EMPTY ONES?  Or do skrulls thrive when infiltrating and invading a planet? Should we make apparent that Gravik's movitvations are instead his daddy issues of having a father figure that would ask him to murder in the name of justice? Should we not have seen some Flashbacks of this happening?  Should this maybe come up in Episode 1? Are skrulls only capable of mimicking and unable to create an original character? What if they took the face of someone but changed it slightly so they are not the same person? Have they not considered that someone with the power to shapeshift living on a planet with people that have no powers.. is like being a god of some sort? Why, why would anyone agree to rebel against this heaven?  This movtivation of ""living in your own skin"" is such bullshit when addressing shapeshifting skrulls. Should the story not have been premised as humans figuring out that there are skrulls amongst them and gravik is trying to protect his own kind by snuffing out these curious people?  Should we hire tv writers that are good at making 40-50 minute episodes consistently? Or shoud we just randomly chop up a 4 hour movie into random bits and pieces and call it an episode?

All this stuff that I, redditors and podcasters have thought of in like literally our spare time should have been thought out by people at marvel. Like, this is about hiring competent people. I'd be so freaking angry if I was Samuel L jackson. I feel so bad for the guy, for the legacy of nick fury. 

But back to my main point. If they made any less material, we are literally talking about one live action show a year. Why should we paying customers advocate for that? How about maybe more contained stories that don't involve the end of the world? Character stories that can exist without drastically affecting the MCU. Heroes for hire? Shang chi Stories? Something ground level that can build up to something bigger later on? "

To eventually support that theory, I had to go back to my favorite Marvel comic book reference source to check what the origin of the multitude of Super Skrulls in Secret Invasion was, and found out that it started with a certain GRANOK (sounding awfully similar to Gravik) to be later perfected by Chief Scientist DRO’GE using the DNA of some of Earth’s mightiest heroes (the Illuminati) he had captured and downloaded the memories/knowledge of..

The first saga of the MCU was almost entirely curated by Fiege, the Russos and Weidon. Ofc there were other people who had input and directive responsibilities, but everything felt coherent and was clearly leading to something that all involved had agreed upon and were working towards with their own projects

Now it just seems like marvel are trying to recapture that by giving others the opportunity, but it just seems like none of these separate teams are communicating, resulting in all the recent projects feeling disconnected with wild, what would of been in previous phases, world changing events now just being ignored as the next person in charge either doesn’t know or care.

(I know, some people can disagree)

This is the only episode I can rewatch just for a good laugh. The way she tries to have some sugar but ends up being caught in the middle of a ""I have to be a superhero NOW"" situation is quite comical. I feel that the show was ALMOST there with that episode. Better writing would've helped though.

To be honest, despite all the criticism the show receives, this episode was better than Secret Invasion and Ms. Marvel combined.

For example, they both use a form of Captain Marvel’s powers, but what’s to say that level of power is actually equivalent to Carol’s? She may still be stronger than them.

I think a lot of fans are not quite happy about how Secret Invasion just created the seemingly most powerful being in G'iah with her possessing the powers of a lot of the superheroes.

Now, if the way that the powers are set up would not allow G'iah to use one specific power for an extended period of time, it would make sense to have secondary powers and she will not be as powerful as she is portraited now (i.e. she HAS the power of Carol Danvers, for example, but can ONLY use it for, say a minute or two at a time then she will have to switch to something else and cannot use it again until x amount of time passes). That could also explain why Grevik did not just use his power to kill Ritson in ep. 4 rather than just use guns. 

This can be done so easily as well because they can make her explain her powers to Sonya when Sonya asks her similar question, like, why don't you just use Carol Danvers' power to start every fight?

Why are there practically no recurring villains in the MCU?,laser16,192,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b3rx6/why_are_there_practically_no_recurring_villains/,1690469101.0,"One thing that became a glaring issue for me after Secret Invasion was the wasted opportunity of a character like Gravik. A shapeshifter with a vendetta against humanity, countless connections and a potluck of superpowers? That feels like the perfect opportunity to have him pop up in more projects going forward. And you don’t even have to use the same actor every time. So why aren’t there more recurring villains?

Obviously there are very few exceptions like Kingpin (barely) and Kang if you’re include variants (and really we’ve only gotten 1 1/2). But I feel like every villain we’ve gotten is either killed off, never seen again or redeemed in some way. A few examples of good villains that could have been recurring:

Gravik - killed off

Loki - redeemed (for the best, but still)

Ulysses Klaue - killed off

Agatha Harkness - will more than likely have some kind of heroic turn in her own show

Red Skull - never seen again

Justin Hammer - never seen again

What do you think is the reasoning behind this?"
Let's talk about the future of Giah for MCU,hoenndex,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bopt3/lets_talk_about_the_future_of_giah_for_mcu/,1690523362.0,"It seems pretty evident that Secret Invasion was a flop. Viewership was not maintained constant throughout the season. The reviews out right now range from mixed to negative. We are seeing disappointment being expressed quite openly and frequently in MCU related reddit pages. 

So, given how this flopped, should we expect Emilia Clarke to want to continue with the MCU? or that the MCU producers will want to have her back? Add to this that hiring her is likely quite expensive. 

I just don't think the chances of Emilia returning in a future project look good. Which opens a can of worms: a mediocre show casually created one of the most overpowered characters in the MCU, but there is a real possibility Giah doesn't show up again in a future project. How is that going to be handled? 

Anyone else worried about the possibility that the plots opened up in Secret Invasion will be handwaved or dropped in future projects?"
"The MCU's made a lot of Diseny+ Shows, What should their futures be?",JMRanger1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c6eo3/the_mcus_made_a_lot_of_diseny_shows_what_should/,1690571711.0,"Marvel made a ***lot*** of Diseny+ shows and I think this level of quantity stops people get invested in the shows because stops the flow of new seasons. Want Loki season 2? Sorry, you gotta cycle through 8 other shows, all very different with very different audiences before we'll get around to it. Many of these projects also become essential viewing for films, leaving people confused when they haven't seen them. I think limiting the number of shows, moving some characters to film and continuing the shorter, cheaper special presentations is the solution and below is my list of what the fates of these shows would be.

* **WandaVision** \- Move to film, give Scarlet Witch a movie already!
* **The Falcon and the Winter Soldier** \- Move to film, Captain America 4 and The Thunderbolts
* **Loki** \- Continue, season 2 is coming soon and they should do a third.
* **Hawkeye** \- Spin-off, A Champions series, Kate Bishop Lead, Ms. Marvel as a key character.
* **Moon Knight** \- Continue, they should announce second season.
* **Ms. Marvel** \- Move to film, The Marvels
* **She-Hulk: Attorney at Law** \- Special Presentations, make multiple, shorter and therefore a lot less expensive for a Law Comedy series with a CGI lead. Also a key character in future Hulk films (if they happen).
* **Secret Invasion** \- One and Done, Fury will continue to appear in lots of projects because he's Nick Fury!
* **Echo** \- One and Done, dropping all episodes the same day kinda shows they don't have long-term plans for this one, Echo will return in Daredevil: Born Again as well.
* **Ironheart** \- Move to film, Armor Wars
* **Agatha: Coven of Chaos** \- ???, No Idea, really depends on what the show is gonna be.
* **Daredevil: Born Again** \- Continue, - they should announce another season.

If they did this some of their most popular series in Daredevil, Loki and Moon Knight would have more regular seasons, while the new special presentations would fill in the gaps. What do you think these shows futures should be? Which ones do you cut? And which ones do you keep?"

If you could rewrite the MCU run of Secret Invasion — how would you have written the story? What would you have included or taken out?,psyfyr,22,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15bk96j,1690509412.0,"This is my *quick* version adapted by mashing up the show with the comics. 

Queen Veranke is the crisis level threat this show was missing along with the paranoia and suspense element being more subtle like in Captain Marvel when you really weren’t sure who was who and Skrulls were stealing new identities constantly — shapeshifting being utilized in a way that was more insidious and mysterious. I also think they should have made the nature of this alien species invading the planet a little more terrifying altogether rather than painting them as a mostly peaceful race. Veranke could have been leading Warskrulls from within the planet/government and Fury could have slowly discovered mid-series that there is a cloaked mothership orbiting outside the planet and she has been monitoring Earth-616 from for some time now… with an army of Skrulls waiting to be unleashed on humanity… then Talos alerts Giah who alerts Gravik who already knows because he is working for her… that’s where Giah and Gravik have their split and Giah alerts other Skrulls to this… then they begin having a civil war while Fury and Talos now deal with threats from both the inside and outside…

As the Skrulls begin waging war on one another there are instances popping up around the world of aliens being murdered and found on the streets… the President is then alerted to the Skrull invasion fleet outside the planet… and decides to alert the people by waging war on all Skrulls… people become aware of their presence and some radical groups start attacking those they think are Skrulls… then the de-cloaking of the mothership happens as Veranke sends a message to the inhabitants of Earth-616 informing them that their planet will now be boarded as world leaders have been compromised. Any city that does not give their allegiance shall be fired upon and destroyed entirely. Classic alien invasion style throwing back to old sci-fi films. This is when she sends in the Super Skrulls to cities across the planet to begin managing resistance and murdering anyone who tries to stop them. Super heroes real identities start coming to light as people realize they have little defense.

The resolution could be finding the Super Skrull device Gravik was operating secretly to create an army behind the scenes and having Talos, Varra, and Giah use it to then team up with Fury for the infiltration of the mothership — all leading to the capture and surrender of Veranke, which would anger the rest of her queendom and cause future tension and lingering threat between the larger Skrull Empire and Earth-616 as they plan to free their queen. The heroes that were left taking down the Super Skrulls as a soft new Avengers appearance and finding their real comrades locked away in an underground base. The American president being impeached and taken out of office. Sonya taking over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury returning to S.A.B.E.R. after having actually accomplished something rather than leaving the planet worse off than he found it — so he is redeemed and his purpose restored which was the whole point of showing him as a fallen man the entire series.

Honestly, most any other version would have been better had it included Veranke and introduced a larger Skrull Empire having a presence in the universe — making the stakes for the Kree-Skrull war heightened and having a real effect on the greater MCU. This would only be possible to execute properly if the episodes were 45 minutes+ and there were at least 9-10 in the series. They absolutely squandered all potential this show had by trying to be so different from the comics that they defeated the entire purpose of Secret Invasion. It didn’t feel like an alien invasion at all — it felt like a generic terrorist attack level threat not much different from plots we’ve seen in other MCU shows. It made sense in FATWS, but it was repetitive and irrelevant to this story and there should have been a fresh and unique plot for the foundation of this show."

Granted it's common for the first week to get the lowest numbers, but Secret Invasion still has a big gap to close, and I'm not confident the viewership increased much in the following weeks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I  will also take this opportunity to remind people that She-Hulk did not really perform poorly relative to other Marvel Studios Disney+ shows. It only appears to do poorly if you don't account for it's lower than average episode length, naturally yielding fewer raw minutes of viewership, even for the same number of viewers. That's probably why it didn't make the charts in the first week. it's hard if you only have half as much potential view time per person as other shows."

I assume this is arranged by Captain Marvel and was a set up for an early scene in her film.

Now, given that the reason the Skrulls need a new home is because they're being actively hunted across the galaxy by the Kree, doesn't the fact that Fury and Danvers were ONE WEEK away from ending that centuries old war and therefore allowing the Skrulls to just go hang out wherever they want without fear of a Kree battlefleet showing up in orbit and levelling the place, mean that instead of failing the Skrulls in return for their helping Fury out, they have actually succeeded perfectly beyond the wildest dreams that any of the Skrulls could possibly conceive of and they're solving all of their problems?

Shouldn't the Skrull council have been aware of this peace conference that they'd be currently packing to go to and been deliriously happy about the fact that Captain Marvel, and therefore Fury, has fulfilled her end of the deal so spectacularly?

The mere existence of this peace conference seems to undermine the entire premise of the central conflict of the show."

Here’s my main point:
Skrhodey, kidnapped and replaced after Civil War, could’ve been an amazing, tragic story. But it needed two scenes. 
It needed a scene/montage/episode?! with Tony Stark. The Skrull has replaced Rhodey, simply to stay close to the Avengers and keep tabs on them for Talos/Gravik. In this scene/montage we see Rava learning more about the best of Tony. She sees him work to help his friend walk again, his joy as Rhodey “miraculously” recovers, his work with humanity. Maybe she even falls a bit in love with him, happy that he has Pepper and Morgan. Maybe, there’s a badass fight scene in the armors. This clears up every point of Rhodey fighting with Tony in IW, Endgame, crying at his death, etc. 
Then a scene with Fury. Skrhodey explains how fury and humanity have thrown away the legacy of Tony Stark. Fury has pissed off to space and chaos reigns on Earth (maybe a FATWS or wnadavision reference). Rava has become a total nihilist, replacing Tony with Gravik and his plans. Fury still kills her, but now maybe he has to deal with the fact that Skrhodey was actively protecting earth while he was blipped.
Does this fix the show? No. But if you’re going to retcon stuff, it has to make sense in universe.
Now the problem. These types of flashbacks are almost impossible. I doubt RDJ would do this. Even if he was willing, are you going to shell out 10mil for this cameo? Hulk has been the professor since endgame(boo) I liked Hawkeye because Hawkeye was in it! Thor’s last movie was… not great and Hemsworth might be taking a break? Chris Evans has said no more Cap. (No Wolverine/Cap in WWII. sad face) can you get Scarjo? Bautista? So any character that carried over from phase 1-3, can never interact with these past characters. This makes retconning infinitely harder because the past is set. There can no longer be “show don’t tell”. Take my above example. Now Rhodey just says all this stuff about Tony. Same scenarios. Maybe he has tears in his eyes. But does that have the same impact? 
It might have been better to wipe the slate clean of characters connected to phase 1-3 or keep them away from anything that needs to change what happened before.

TLDR: The MCU needs to stop retconning stories that would require or be helped by it’s legacy actors"

That was rough, folks. A crossover-level event that was a total non-event.

So much of post-ENDGAME has felt disconnected and disposable. And that’s fine if we’re on an experimental detour like WandaVision or Moon Knight, or in an extra-dimensional space like Loki. 

But you compare Secret Invasion with something like the Avengers, and it falls short on every level. This isn’t a culmination of storylines that intertwine to make everything feel bigger. It’s a big blinking sign that says, “Nothing matters, we’re just killing time, running out contrasts, and exploiting pre-existing IP.”

I remember when Covid was still around that I kinda figured that the pandemic was the reason why certain shows were feeling lackluster. Best example of this is FATWS since that show had a whole pandemic plot line that seemed to be one of the main plots which was cut for obvious reasons… and well the quality of the tv series shows given how most of their lead way was cut.




But we’re in 2023 now… what the fuck is going on? After that abomination that was She-Hulk (at least some people like that show) Secret Invasion was the comeback for Disney+ shows… and wow what a let down.



I think we can all agree that the finale just felt extremely lackluster and the fact that it was only 30 minutes is embarrassing. The show definitely needed more episodes or longer episodes cause this definitely could’ve been something great. 




It just pisses me off how there seems to be no love for these kind of projects anymore. Rhodey is a character we all loved for years and they don’t even elaborate on his Skrull whereabouts. Why the fuck do we gotta wait to find out I mean wasn’t that suppose to be the twist of this show? Also if Rhodey was a skrull during Endgame or Infinity War then I’m genuinely done with the MCU since that is just pure garbage right there. 





Anyhoo, when it comes to the films it definitely feels better. Sure you have some misses like Quantumania but at least that film is enjoyable thanks to Kang or some funny moments, overall though the films have a ton of hits I mean Vol 3 was extraordinary alongside Wakanda Forever and The Marvels looks great. 





Hopefully Loki S2 and Echo make up for this, but honestly I’ve disliked most of the shows and I’m really close to just avoiding all of them, felt like Secret Invasion was a waste of time for me."

My take on Secret Invasion.,eBICgamer2010,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bx3y3/my_take_on_secret_invasion/,1690549941.0,"With that $200M, it should have been just a 2-and-half-an-hour-long movie. And I would have called it Avengers: Secret Invasion.

However, I want to keep it small. It would have been like this:

* Skrulls found a new home planet. Great, it's the Garden from way back in Endgame. But the Skrulls are still being harassed by Krees. Captain Marvel is on her way to the peace summit to negotiate for peace.
* Gravik, an up-and-coming member within the Skrull Army, isn't confident about the success of the peace talk, so he acts ahead. He and his band of Skrull rebel plans to set a colony on Earth permanently, and wins support from officials of world power by disguising as them and give good enough PR to convince everyone they can stay just like New Asgardians (as depicted in Love &amp; Thunder)
* Gravik gets rid of both Talos and Soren by disguising as Fury and fooling them over the progress of the peace meeting. G'iah and Fury are on SABER and were informed by Maria Hills to come down to Earth. There the three talked about something wrong at the latest Congress meeting.
* The US was weighing relation with New Asgard over the shape-shifting incident as depicted in She-Hulk. Rhodey was initiating a vote on whether they should restrict shape-shifters from entering the US but everyone there unanimously voted no later in the day. Something's fishy going on, because it's true.
* Rhodey and everyone in the meeting are Skrulls. Fury boards a flight to LA to recruit She-Hulk because she dealt with the New Asgardian shape-shifting case before. Then Fury, Hills, Walter and G'iah ambush a podcast, catch a rebel Skrull acting as PR and force that Skrull to tell Gravik's ploy.
* Gravik's in his hideout in Russia. That's where they want to colonize and also where they kept most of the abducted officials there, Rhodey too, though that place isn't radioactive. Fury's band arrive in time and catch him off-guard.
* There were skirmishes as She-Hulk hulks out to scare the rebels. G'iah found out about her dead parents and got emotional. Gravik's force gets wiped out by She-Hulk. Gravik tries to back out but G'iah had a standoff with him. There's pretty much no CGI battle between the two Skrulls here like in the show because they didn't use any machine to give them Super Saiyan power. AT ALL.
* The good Skrulls band alongside G'iah, who have heard of good news surrounding the peace talk, agree to execute him. In the end, a new status quo emerges: Skrulls finally found a home without being threatened by the Krees or stabbed by the rotten apples.
* From the event, Fury got spooked. He now goes back to recruiting mode, starting with She-Hulk and a recovering War Machine. In a post credit scene, various news outlets announce that US incumbent president lost the election to General Ross, who had continuously criticized his handling of the event."

Strongest hero?,yoshmeisterr,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bj4qt/strongest_hero/,1690506242.0,"So I guess G,l'ah is the strongest person in the MCU seeing that she literally has every other heros power.. but what I'm thinking is that her powers aren't 100% compared to let's say carol Danvers powers"
"IMO, Marvel should be doing 2, 10-12 episode seasons for shows AT MOST",Paperchampion23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bwh2a/imo_marvel_should_be_doing_2_1012_episode_seasons/,1690548329.0,"Just thinking about the format, and clearly the issue is two fold. Too many shows (we get 3-4 per year and will this year) that are too short. 

Ideally Daredevil is the beginning of longer form storytelling, but after it Wonder Man and Vision Quest are next on the docket. My ""hope"" is that they are all that exist for assumedly 2026. I say that year for several reasons:

- Due to the strikes I highly doubt Ironheart, Agatha and DD all release next year

- This means the only completed shows premiering in 2024 will likely be Ironheart and Agatha

- 2025 may be solely reserved for Daredevil, given its length and current rumor it is being split up similar to Andor's 24 episode story. I.e. 2, 9 episode ""seasons""

- 2026 would then be Wonder Man and Vision Quest,


At this point, Marvel could hopefully course correct on show rollout. A big issue is too much is going on and not enough payoff is being seen in the films. Let the films catch up. Let The Marvels payoff WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. Let CA4, Thunderbolts payoff F+WS and Hawkeye, etc.

On the concern of second seasons, I argue that second seasons of Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, and Ms. Marvel ideally need to just wait like films at this point. Ms. Marvel not included, but ideally Jen and Marc should be in some other property beforehand, not just isolated to Season 2's of their shows. And unfortunately all of that is taking (the necessary) time. 

Idk, we all talk about Marvel slowing down, but I feel like THIS is how you slow down. Its a shame itll take so long to see characters like Shang-Chi (or set up characters like Dane Whitman) again, but at this point, Marvel doesnt have a choice really.

And the concern for Young Avengers and aging, I think we'll just see the ""Ultimates"" instead eventually. 


Tldr:

- 2023: The Marvels, Loki S2, Echo
- 2024: CA4, DP3, Ironheart and Agatha (thats it, Thunderbolts definitely is delayed)
- 2025: Thunderbolts, Blade, F4, Spider-Man 4 (maybe), Daredevil 
- 2026: Armor Wars, Avengers Kang Dynasty, Wonder Man, and Vision Quest (likely another film i.e. Doctor Strange 3 or Shang-Chi 2 but theres nothing else currently on the docket that not just a ""rumor"")"
What if Secret Invasion is just the beginning?,spider_sweater,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bwgpg/what_if_secret_invasion_is_just_the_beginning/,1690548304.0,"So, I know technically it sort of is. That is if Secret Wars still happens. But there’s a lot of criticism about the series. And I agree that it had issues. But in hindsight, I sort of see it as the pilot episode of a show: it has to introduce everything and can be a bit dry and lackluster.

Looking at it from this perspective helps alleviate how I think about some of the choices made. 

Now, I’m not trying to excuse some of those choices but I am trying to look at them from a different perspective."
Concerning New Asgard?,minesfromacanteen,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bjiho/concerning_new_asgard/,1690507309.0,"The US president is basically targeting all off-world species as enemy combatants. He wants them designated as such in a bill. I've been wondering about how the public would react to skrulls if they revealed themselves openly, which the president has already done. What's it like for New Asgard? Thor relocated all the Asgardians to New Asgard in Norway after their home planet was destroyed. Valkyrie might be dealing with enough as it is and now the president wants this bill as a kneejerk reaction to the events of Secret Invasion.

Some of the kids in New Asgard look very different from humans, and it's probably not easy fitting in. Same goes for the skrulls and they had to maintain a hideout in Russia to survive. Would New Asgard have been willing to help the skrulls out? And why didn't Fury tell anyone about New Asgard? He must know about it right? Did Valkyrie have too much on her plate to be worrying about skrulls?"

They did his “dirty work” and it was morally ambiguous. This sounds like a really interesting show! 

I’m not a writer, I’ve had ups and downs with the MCU, but Secret Invasion is the first thing I’ve absolutely disliked. And it’s at least partially because it was about so many things we had never seen and were never explained. 

If we’d seen some of this pre-Thanos stuff we could have seen some character development. Basically we don’t know anything about any Skrulls except Talos, and he died! They are clearly sympathetic characters, but without some actual armories about them, they are just lame collateral damage."

Unanswered secret invasion questions,Unusual-Math-1505,37,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b4ibc/unanswered_secret_invasion_questions/,1690470861.0,"1)Why did Gravik kill Soren?

2)What is the Skrull colony with the emperor? It was just mentioned in 1 sentence and then never again

3)When was rhodey replaced? “A long time” was so clearly the writers saying “it’s not our problem, that’s a job for the next guy”

4)when was Ross replaced?

5)if gravik’s plan revolved around the US president declaring war why wouldn’t he just replace the president and do it himself

6)Why can’t the skrulls live on Thanos’ garden? It’s huge, Thanos was the only inhabitant, it can support life, and no one knows about it except the avengers (including Carol). If the kree could find them there then why wouldn’t the kree be able to find them anywhere? And if the reason why they never come to earth is because of Carol and the avengers why would Gravik antagonize the humans and the avengers against the skrulls?

7)why would Skrull rhodey call Fury “Nick” if it knows that rhodey never calls him Nick (by having all Rhode’s memories

8)if aSkrull has all the memories of the host do they also care about the loved ones of that person?

9)what happened to that boy after Talos killed his “father”. Did Fury and Talos not explain anything? Is that boy now just alone and traumatized? Was he a Skrull? Probably not as Fury and Talos never question or kill him. And he doesn’t serve any tactical benefit to replace. And fury was holding him hostage and a Skrull would easily be able to overpower fury.

10)The skrulls’ shapeshifting abilities are very ill defined. Can they change into animals? We know that skrulls can’t tell if a Skrull is disguised as something else so what is stopping anyone from impersonating anyone? How do they have a society at all? Like why wouldn’t Gaia or Talos shift into Gravik and call everything off?

11)why didn’t the tortured Skrull shift into a smaller person to slip out of the chains? Why couldn’t he break the chains like he said he would?

12)Why did Fury make Gravik kill the man he is disguised as? It would have been nice to know the context of that kill.

13)why does no one (except Olivia Coleman) check that who they are talking to is who they are talking to if there is a possibility that they are a Skrull? Why not just cut off some hair or take a drop of blood if it changes after it’s separated from the main Skrull body then their cover is blown.

14)why wouldn’t Gravik make more super skrulls for his army? And if some of the skrulls planned to turn on him why didn’t they make themselves super skrulls like Gaia did?

15)why give Gravik the harvest in the first place ultimately it didn’t do anything

16)why did the skrulls rely on just fury to find them a planet and what were those other 1,000,000 skrulls doing for 30 years. 

17)where were fury’s skrulls during the events of the MCU? They would have been very useful in winter soldier or avengers or aou or infinity war etc…

18)how did the captured humans survive the radiation in the skrulls’ base?

19)why did Gaia use a Geiger counter if she is immune to the radiation?

20) why was Gaia able to kill Gravik so easily if they have the same powers? Why wouldn’t Gravik just stay as Carol Danvers who is immune to everything and has the strongest power output anyway? What is the point of using Drax dna when you can use Carol?

21)why are skrulls and kree making peace suddenly?

22)how were the kree always able to find the skrulls?

23)why is graviks first response to kill all humans even though no one knows about the skrulls and haven’t had a chance to be peacefull with them? 

24)why wouldn’t fury call for help from some of the non powered avengers like Hawkeye or Ant man or falcon or even Bucky or any of the magic users like strange and wong he didn’t even try consulting with Bruce who is one of the smartest people in the world"

Answering a couple of misconceptions from the SI finale,KostisPat257,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c5syt/answering_a_couple_of_misconceptions_from_the_si/,1690570327.0,"I was underwhelmed and disapointed by SI as well.

It wasn't a paranoid thriller/mystery like it was supposed to be, it was too small in scale and too self-contained, it did a lot of tell, but not much show in order to present and develop its characters and its story properly, it was a movie chopped up in pieces with each piece not advancing the plot enough or have enough mystery and intrigue to warrant a weekly release and it fumbled Fury's character development and the coherence of his motivations at the end.

That said, there are some things that people are criticising the finale for that are just misconceptions, so I would like to clear them up.

1. Drax's tattoos, Hulk's pants, Ebony Maw's rings etc are of course not part of their DNA. But you are forgetting that these are SKRULLS. They are not just imitating these people's powers, but also their external appearance. A skrull can turn into Drax and they can copy his tattoos as well without even needing his DNA. What he needs the DNA for is to take Drax's powers. So G'iah ad Gravik imitating these heroes' and villains' appearances is unrelated to them using their powers and it was only done to visualize to the audience which powers each of them were using at each moment.
2. Fury didn't abandon the Skrulls at the end. It's apparent a week or 2 have passed since Ritson's announcement and Fury stayed on Earth, probably protecting the Skrulls, until he (probably with Carol's help) could arrange the Kree-Skrull peace talks. And since The Marvels &gt;!starts with said peace talks!&lt; according to its leaked plot, we'll get a little conclusion to the future of the Skrulls! "

The eternals I just don’t think we have room to explore simple as that. 

They Young Avengers could’ve been a fun one time TV series but the set up has been really weird. Honestly they needed the guardians/eternals approach of just introducing them all in the one Project, especially if it’s a show then that’s not too bad. 

Maybe allow some of them in other projects but ONLY where they make sense. Kate Bishop in a Hawkeye show? Sure that’s okay, America Chavez in a dr strange movie? Doesn’t fit at all. 

They honestly could’ve taken the comics approach to them and it would’ve been fine, they have their few runs (or in this case one project) then half the cast may as well be dead and the others fade in and out of obscurity, only to be written well when Al Ewing decides he wants to stick them on a random team he’s writing again. 

But this long drawn out introduction of them means by the time the project comes out not only will they have created problems in all the projects they didn’t belong in but also they won’t even be Young at all lol."

A Rewrite of Secret Invasion,PimpNinjaMan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c3hjb/a_rewrite_of_secret_invasion/,1690564837.0,"Secret Invasion frustrated me. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because I kept enjoying *moments* and then getting frustrated with how those moments played out or how they were (or weren't) resolved. I really didn't like the way the Super Skrull was handled and I think the power level in the finale didn't match the energy of the rest of the show. That led me to write what is basically fan fiction, but its how I would have written the show. A few caveats: 

1. I imagine the show *must* be only 6 episodes. 
2. I didn't include any changes to Sonya or Priscilla because I loved their characters. Assume as many of their scenes are retained as possible! 
3. The show must end with Skrulls being known about. 
4. Nick Fury must survive the finale. 

With those in mind, here is how *I* would've written Secret Invasion:

#  Episode 1

Gravik and co. infiltrate a SHIELD base looking for something (the audience doesn't know what it is). They don't find it and Gravik is pissed. Another person in the unit says, ""Sir, this is the fifth place we've looked."" Gravik responds, ""If we can't find it, we'll find the man who hid it."" Later, Gravik disguises himself as Maria Hill and starts committing random terrorist acts to try and get Fury down from space. The episode ends with Fury arriving on Earth.  

# Episode 2

Fury investigates Hill but gets caught by Gravik who plans to use the Skrull brain device to search for this mysterious item. Gravik is surprised by how easy it was to kidnap Fury and starts underestimating him. They find the location of the item in Fury's memoreis and leave to retrieve it. Another Skrull offers to take on Fury's body in case there's some fingerprint scan or something but Gravik says, ""No Skrull should have to sully themselves by putting on the face of this man."" Gravik then tells Fury, ""I'm leaving you alive so you can watch me do what you should’ve done years ago"" and walks away. 

# Episode 3

Maria Hill (the real one) arrives to save Fury. Hill says was investigating her imposter when she found him. He says they don't have time and calls up Talos. As Fury is explaining the situation, Talos assures him that it will be fine and gives him a place to meet. As they meet, Talos pulls out a piece of paper and reads from it: ""As he writes, without looking at the sea..."" As Talos continues reading the poem by Raymond Carver, we see Fury's memories returning. In Fury's memories, we see him hand Talos something in a box, then later we see him talking with Wong. We find out Fury asked Wong to erase his memories of hiding the item, indicating it was for the protection of Earth. Wong says he won't remove them, but he can block them with a spell. Fury agrees, and when Wong asks for a trigger phrase to remove the block, Fury hands him the book of poems and says, ""Pick your favorite."" As Talos reads the last line of the poem, it cuts back to current day and we see Talos holding the box. 

Hill asks what's so important about the box and Talos interjects and says, ""You think he's actually going to tell us? Who's Nick Fury without his secrets?"" Fury closes his eyes and then opens the box, revealing a small object. As he touches the object, a hologram of a planet appears. Talos starts tearing up and Fury explains that he found a planet for the Skrulls years ago but couldn't risk losing their help in protecting Earth. He wanted to share it with Talos, but after the 2012 attack, couldn't risk giving up his secret army. Talos storms off furious. 

# Episode 4

Gravik doesn’t find the coordinates where it was in Fury’s brain and retaliates by staging an attack on Russia by Americans. He calls Fury and tells him that he will burn the Earth if Fury doesn't give him the coordinates. Fury agrees and meets with Gravik. Fury hands over the coordinates, but then Gravik says, ""Still. With everything I've done, he *still* won't stop making us do his dirty work."" and then he shoots Fury. As Fury falls, we see it was actually Talos. This marks Gravik's shift to pure vengeance. Even though he now has the coordinates, he still wants to destroy all humans. The Skrull council tries to stop him and says they can help coordinate a retreat to this new planet, but Gravik convinces them that the humans won't take kindly to them living on their planet and stealing spaceships. The council compromises by saying they'll coordinate the retreat in secret, but Gravik is still pissed.

# Episode 5

Fury mourns Talos and talks with Hill, where he has to come to grips with all the things he's done in an effort to protect Earth. He wonders if its worth it and Hill says, ""there's no way to know for sure. All we can do is make sure there is a generation after us that lives to judge us for our actions."" Fury assumes he's about to be forced into retirement (since his secret army is about to leave the planet) when he gets a call from Rhodey. Rhodey tells him that Gravik has gone against the council and is planning on continuing to start nuclear war. Fury asks how he knows this and Rhodey says, ""I'm a Skrull. Get over it."" (a callback to Iron Man 2). Skrull Rhodey agrees to help Fury stop Gravik as long as Fury helps with the evacuation. Fury agrees, and the gang gets going. 

# Episode 6

Fury, Rhodey, and Hill infiltrate Gravik's compound to stop the attack when they realize Gravik just fought off a mutiny. They talk to a dying skrull who explains that the group worried Gravik's war would destroy their means of escape and Gravik responded by killing one of them. He's off to a russian military base to try and send a nuke to the US. Rhodey (in his War Machine armor), Fury, and Hill head to the base to stop Gravik. Gravik explains that he wants a new home, but says to Fury, “I want you to know what it’s like to watch your home burn.” Then he launches the nuke before Hill shoots him. Skrull Rhodey flies off to deal with it. Fury runs to Gravik while Hill tries to call the US to explain what’s happening. Fury apologizes to Gravik, but Gravik smiles and says, “You’ve fought so hard to protect this place, and for what? My people have had to hide for decades because *you* are so despicable that you will kill us simply for the way we look. You were meant to be our savior, and you used us. Sent us to die. For what? Earth? What does Earth have that makes it worth all this sacrifice?” As Fury struggles to answer, Gravik finally dies. 

The next scene shows the President making an address, outlining the failed attack and showing footage of Gravik’s base, with the dead skrulls as well as the retrieval of the humans Gravik was using (such as Rhodey). Rather than talking about Skrull Rhodey’s sacrifice, the message is very dark, talking about this group having infiltrated us and living among us. 

\---

And that's it! I know this is reddit and not Ao3, but I wanted to share this since so many people have been talking about what they would've done differently. I didn't include Gai'ah since I felt her character was introduced solely to have a ""good"" Super Skrull, so since I scrapped all the Super Skrull stuff it didn't fit. 

How would *you* have written Secret Invasion?

How Phase Four Should Have Ended..,_sidxx__,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15brq6b/how_phase_four_should_have_ended/,1690533780.0,"We all know phase 4 of the MCU has divided the entire fandom, although most people would agree that the general quality of projects has taken a hit. I have a few ideas on how the short-lived phase could've been way more exciting than it ended up being.

If there were an **Avengers** film at the end of Phase 4, fans and the general audience would likely be much more invested in the franchise. 

* After Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, we could've had an Avengers film, titled ""**Avengers: Judgement Day**"" which would follow the remaining Eternals on the Domo finding out about Arishem's assault on Earth, leaving them no choice but to turn to other heroes on Earth and across the cosmos. This would be a minor threat that could set up the rest of the Multiverse Saga and Kang as the big bad.
* The film could've included The Eternals, Sam Wilson's Captain America, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Thor, Shang-Chi, Scarlett Witch, Shuri's Black Panther and the Hulk. A rather smaller cast so there would be more room for characters to interact with each other and build new dynamics with each other which could be further developed in future phases. 
* This would've allowed these characters to spend more time with each other and laid the groundwork for the multiverse saga (something like defeating the Celestials eliminated forces protecting the universe from colliding with others) and introducing  Kang The Conqueror in a post-credits scene perhaps. 

This could've been a more satisfying end to the phase while paving the way for future projects, along with rewarding audiences for sitting through mediocre content.  Phase 5 could then begin to integrate younger/newer heroes into the mix (She-Hulk, Ms Marvel, Moon Knight, etc) with Phase 6 being all about alternate universes, ending with a big bang (Kang Dynasty &amp; Secret Wars).

Do ya'll think this would've worked as a bridge to the multiverse saga rather than having to wait for 5 years before all these characters could star in the same film while barely having a connection?"

I actually liked how they did this scene, even if it didn't quite track as real. But, then again, it's shapeshifting aliens infused with superhero DNA in a fight to save the Earth, so ""being real"" wasn't my biggest concern.

Just my opinion."
SkRhodey Explanation,NoDoubtRobocop,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bnhyp/skrhodey_explanation/,1690519322.0,"Reasons why SkRhodey was only replaced after the events of ""Endgame"" and not after ""Civil War"":

1. Memories - Its been established in Captain Marvel that Skrulls only get the most recent memories of their host body. In Endgame, when Rhodey is speaking with Nat through Hologram Video Call, he knew the history and deep relationship between Nat and Clint like he was concerned for the both of them. I highly doubt SkRhodey caring or wasting time anything at all. 

2. Leg Injury - Secret Invasion shows a Rhodey on a Hospital Gown seemingly unable to walk. That's because he was not wearing the tech supposedly helping him to walk as shown in Endgame or Infinity War. It can be said that after the events of Endgame Rhodey went to the hospital to get his injuries checked from the battle and that may be the period where he got replaced. 

3. No Gravin Plans Yet - During Civil War event, it can be assumed that Nick Fury is still in good terms with Gravik and the Skrulls even up until the event of Endgame where Gravik helped Fury to collect Avengers DNA. Hence, there can be no any justifiable reasons or whatsoever that would motivate a Skrull to switch Rhodey.

4. Heroic Moment in Endgame - During a very critical moment on Endgame where Rhodey, Rocket, and Hulk were trapped on a wasted Avengers Compound. Rhodey worked hard on saving Rocket and we can visibly see his struggles on mobilizing his leg. I don't think SkRhodey is an Oscar Actor to be able to pull out such attitude.

The whole multiverse stuff as a whole has felt lazy too.

Why are some characters different looking than others? How does it even really all work considering it feels like multiple different movies or shows express it in a different light or way? There’s no buildup, or understanding of it.

I kind of liken this to when music fans ask for their favorite artist to make an album that sounds like a fan favorite album from 10+ years ago. I get it’s a fan favorite but this person is not the same person as they were 10 years ago and the MCU is not Marvel Comics. They use comics as a basis to pull from but create new, unique stories and ideas.

Don't think I need to explain that. Writers are well-paid, yes. But executives sitting in an office doing next to no work get paid hundreds or thousands of times what they do, so they're looking to get a bigger piece of that. 

The real issue is the AI. You might think, ""AI written stuff all sucks and is clearly written by a robot."" That's true. The problem is that you can have an AI program write the worst premise of all time, pay writers to rewrite it until it's in a workable state, and then the person who got the AI generated premise still owns 100% of the rights to it, despite coming up with almost none of the meat of the story themselves. 

So imagine you tell chat GPT, ""Write me a Captain America movie premise"". 

Here's a real premise I just got from Chat GPT: 

**Title: ""Captain America: Legacy Reborn""

Logline: After Steve Rogers retires from the mantle of Captain America, a new hero emerges: Michael Collins, a former Army Ranger with a mysterious past. As the new Captain America, Michael must navigate the pressures of living up to a legendary legacy while confronting a dangerous organization hell-bent on destabilizing the world order. With old allies and new adversaries, Michael must embrace the true meaning of heroism and discover what it truly takes to be a symbol of hope in a world desperate for salvation.**



So obviously that logline sucks and tells us nothing. The problem is that then Bob Iger and his pals can pay writers the lowest number possible to rewrite that into something workable. They'd have to come up with the dangerous organization, which old allies come back, who the new adversaries are, etc. And Disney would own 100% of the rights to it because they ""came up"" with the story. 

So while you may be rocking around all worried about MCU shows and movies getting delayed, there's an extremely good reason."

New as in “after the Netflix shows”.

Then I decided to give Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. a chance. I like Joss Whedon's older television projects.

But it seems I'm not used to the old television format anymore, with over 20 episodes per season and the writing that comes along with this.

I'm still in the first half of the first season, and I read that people say the first season isn't as good as the rest. And that it started to get a bit better with the second half of the first season.

But then I don't understand the user ratings for the episodes of season 1: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/ratings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/ratings) (scroll down to “Ratings by episode”)

Are the good ratings due to fans rewatching the show over and over again, putting the first episodes in the context of the later episodes they already know?

I enjoyed other shows and movies with a below 7.5 rating, especially if they are in a genre I like. But I wouldn't give the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode I watched more than 5 bis 6 stars.

**Is this just a sign that the show isn't for me, or are the ratings not reflecting the real quality?**

Because I don't know if I should continue if I can't trust that the episodes with over 8 stars are really that good, if I think 7.5 stars are just plain wrong."
Marvel needs to start taking their time with these Disney+ shows.,just_a_guy9138,1127,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a9gzz/marvel_needs_to_start_taking_their_time_with/,1690386648.0,"After Secret Invasion, I can fully say I’m disappointed in where Marvel is headed when it comes to doing these Disney+ shows. The show always starts out interesting with 50 minutes of content in the beginning, but start to wane when it comes to the third episode or so. Plot threads start to feel rushed and by the finale, you leave unsatisfied. 

That’s the way I feel with Secret Invasion. What was the point of the 200+ million budget if we get a bunch of half-assed action scenes and cheap looking sets? Why are there still plot threads unresolved and leaving you with more questions than answers by the end of the series? I don’t feel satisfied watching these shows like I did with the Netflix shows or even AoS. I think that Marvel needs to take a step back, and hire some quality writers. Stop rushing things to put out content. I honestly wouldn’t mind less shows and movies per year as long as what we got was of quality. After Ant-Man 3 and this show, I’m starting to feel the toll of bland nothingburgers we’ve been getting in this Phase. I’m cautiously optimistic for Daredevil because it’s 18 episodes with arcs, but since the writers strike has delayed it, we still might be getting poor quality. 

The only good thing I’ve seen Marvel do was delay The Marvels to November. If it means better writing and CGI, I’m all for it. I just want to see the excitement and hype I had for the MCU prior to Endgame. I hope Marvel learns from this and starts to take these projects more seriously from now on."

What if Vision shot down Tony Stark instead of James Rhodes? [CACW],dmreif,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bjtxj/what_if_vision_shot_down_tony_stark_instead_of/,1690508206.0,"Put it simply, how would the final act of *Captain America: Civil War* have played out if Tony was injured instead of Rhodey? Let's say the airport battle  was the same up until Rhodey orders Vision to fire on Sam. When Vision fires, Sam dodges, but instead of Rhodey, it's Tony gets hit. Tony falls to Earth and is  paralyzed, like Rhodey is in the film. From here, I think there's two ways this would play out:

**Scenario A: Jailbreak**

Clint, Sam, Scott, and Wanda are captured and taken to the Raft while Rhodey and Vision accompany Tony to the hospital. While Tony is in surgery, Rhodey feels very guilty and ashamed. He blames himself for Tony's injuries. He was, after all, the one who ordered Vision to fire on Sam. He also is horrified by the results, because if Vision's beam could take out Tony's arc reactor, it probably would've destroyed Sam's jetpack and maybe killed him in the air. He has his interaction with Natasha, and then he gets the information from the authorities about Zemo and about Bucky being framed.

Rhodey, Natasha and Vision decide to visit the Raft to get information on Zemo and the HYDRA base from the captured members of Team Cap, and to give this information to Ross. When they get there, though, they take an instant dislike to how Team Cap are being treated. Vision is appalled and sickened by the sight of Wanda in a straitjacket and shock collar, and protests to Ross, ""You can't do that! It's illegal!"" to which Ross probably just retorts, ""Listen, Wonder Man,  I give the orders here. I determine the protocols."" Vision isn't having it. He punches Ross out, and goes down to free Wanda, while Rhodey and Natasha go to the cells where Clint, Scott, and Sam are being held. They go to Sam, and persuade him to give him the information on the HYDRA base. Sam does so, but by that point, Vision comes in with a freed Wanda. They decide to free Sam, Clint, and Scott, and after a fight scene with the Raft guards, they get on the Quinjet, and fly to Siberia to meet up with Steve and Bucky.

**Scenario B: Medical Aid**

When Tony hits the ground, Sam goes to work. Unlike Tony, Rhodey has the common sense to realize that at this point, someone being grievously injured is more important than being divided by the Accords, so helps Sam do his job. During this time, Vision flies over with Wanda. Wanda's still a bit out of it from Rhodey using a sonic cannon on her earlier, and still pissed at Rhodey for that and for Tony firing missiles at her, but she also elects to assist Sam. Actually, she ends up being useful in that her powers allow her to rip off Tony's suit off to make things easier for Sam. While they're doing this, Sam and Wanda are able to talk things out with Natasha, Rhodey and Vision about what's going on with the threat of Zemo and the Winter Soldiers, during which Wanda also vents over Tony interning her in the compound (both of these things strike a nerve with Rhodey).

Understanding the threat that Zemo poses, Rhodey decides that stopping Zemo and the Winter Soldiers is more important than enforcing the Accords, and that Tony might very well have just doomed the world by choosing to start this fight over a bruised ego. Once Rhodey and Sam have ensured that Tony is stabilized, they, plus Wanda, Clint and Scott convince T'Challa to fly them to Siberia in his plane, and take Natasha and Vision with them. This group of Rhodey, T'Challa, Natasha, Sam, Clint, Scott, Wanda, and Vision then meets up with Steve and Bucky before they can enter the HYDRA base.

**Both Scenarios**

In both scenarios, Zemo ends up electing not to kill the Winter Soldiers. Instead, he sets them loose, and the Avengers end up having to battle all five of them. After a drawn out battle, they kill the Winter Soldiers and capture Zemo.  They then use Zemo as a bargaining chip to get Ross to not pursue charges against them, probably by pointing out how it would look terrible to Ross to arrest them when they just saved the world  again, and also because the way things played out show that if they'd been bound by the Accords, they'd have been prevented from stopping Zemo in time. (As a bonus, Wanda uses her telepathy to convince Ross to start investigating Tony for his involvement in Ultron's creation, and to blame the airport battle solely on Tony as well.) The UN are also forced to strike down the Accords in light of reports about what happened in Siberia.

And another big reason the Accords are struck down is because these reports on what happened reflect terribly on...Tony Stark. The fight, the airport getting trashed, and getting crippled, those are all Tony's fault because he decided not to listen to Steve's attempts to explain the situation and the threat that Zemo posed. The rest of Team Iron Man (Rhodey, Vision and Natasha) showed a willingness to work with those opposing the Accords to stop this threat, but it required Tony to be out of commission for them to successfully talk things out. 

The upside is that Team Cap would be the moral victors in this conflict, with those who fought on Tony's side being forced to admit that they were wrong for trying to stop Team Cap from saving the world."

Yea this would have killed Rhodes and Ross but so what? You lose one future project in Armor Wars, but have the opportunity to throw some true chaos into the MCU. If it was revealed that Rhodes was actually dead since say civil war it may have been interesting. Now it doesn't really matter when he was replaced since he's basically fine now and nothing he did was out of character except for in the show. So it doesn't matter when he was replaced or anyone else for the most part.

 If all the people were killed when replaced you would now have multiple characters and world leaders now gone which would make things far more interesting for the next captain america movie and the general world dynamic going forward.

Now, I completely understand that we are still in early phases leading up to Secret Wars (which at this point, who knows if that’s this eras endgame). 

The only show out of all of them that got away with these runtimes was WandaVision and that was so very specific to the groundbreaking storytelling that was. Even those 20 some minutes episodes were necessary. 

But these other projects.. the whole point was to be able to have HBO/NETFLIX level quality in storytelling!!! When we have all these wonky runtimes parts of the story aren’t hitting at the right points in time, plot that’s supposed to happen at the 20 minute mark or whatever time are getting LOST or not even addressed.

\- after the snap things went sideways and Talos started to lose his leadership, the Skrull council was (re)formed and tried to/took more power in general

\-after the blip Fury wasn't a role model anymore and him leaving again for the Sabre was enough for the Council to remove Talos from decision making - I guess on that point(or after the snap itself) Skrulls started to take humans places in various organisations. Maybe the idea was to rule Earth peacefully and create a save heaven for shapeshifters somewhere on the Earth but Gravik opposed that as a radical and preferred full out war and annihilation of humans

\- when Fury was gone Talos sent a signal to all the other Skrulls out there to come to Earth and those Skrulls joined different factions working by different methods

\- then we have Secret Invasion events

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest I feel like there can be another faction of Skrulls (send by the emperor) which are really doing secret invasion for their purposes what we will see in the future."

Secret Invasion fumbled the fact that Captain Marvel was set in the 90s.,meme_abstinent,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bgnk6/secret_invasion_fumbled_the_fact_that_captain/,1690499594.0,"This argument stems from my opinion that Rhodey should have been a Skrull the entire time.

Why set Captain Marvel in the 90s? Fury meets Carol, learns about aliens and names the Avengers after her call-sign, these are all payoffs for making the movie a prequel. But these payoffs are shallow.

It’s the same as explaining why Han calls Chewbaka Chewy. Because his name is too long. Sometimes an ambiguous backstory is just as enthralling as knowing the grizzly details, and sometimes you learn you could’ve gone without knowing (Goose taking Fury’s eye) but we are getting off track.

I thought that by introducing Skrulls to Earth in the 90s and a couple years later announcing Secret Invasion, that that would mean for decades the Skrulls have been planning this, a true espionage situation.

Shoot Winter Soldier handled the passage of time like this. Even Black Widow acknowledged that the decades that had past since Ohio shifted where our characters were and power dynamics. 

But Secret Invasion doesn’t do this with its main selling point.

Rhodey was a perfect candidate for being a Skrull the entire time. He has little to no characterization outside of “military man who is Tony Stark’s best friend” and they could have used his lack of characterization as a strength here, but instead they didn’t. And even worse, they may rob him of his most significant moments if he has been a Skrull since Civil War. If he’s been a Skrull since FatWS then what the fuck was the point? What kind of consequences are those? That’s pussy storytelling."

That gets derided by a lot of people, some cinephiles especially, as soulless cash-grab IP monetization. (Ask those people if they feel the same way about Antoine Doinel showing up in five separate films by François Truffaut.)

But with that promise there is peril, and Secret Invasion shines a huge spotlight on exactly the problem.

**SPOILERS**

Marvel Studios has a huge problem now, and IMO it’s bigger than “doesn’t anyone notice the giant new rock formation that kind of looks like a head and a hand?”, or “why didn’t Hawkeye jump in to help Spider-Man at the Statue of Liberty?”

I do believe our suspension of disbelief can stretch that far.

But it absolutely *breaks* if we’re expected to swallow that the President of the United States goes on air, announces shape-shifting aliens, declares war on all off-planet born species … and now Daredevil only really cares or talks about some shady land deal the Kingpin is making.

**Wishful Thinking Time**

In the vast multiverse of “what if?”, there’s a version of the MCU in which AVENGERS: SECRET WAR was the end of Phase 4, in which the movies and shows were planned out to drop hints of a Skrull terrorist cell, in which the movie begins with an assassination attempt BY FURY(!), in which the movie centers on Fury clearing his name and getting to the bottom of the conspiracy, in which we learned that many of those who “came back” after the Snap had died of natural causes and Skrulls saw an opportunity, in which the ending raises serious moral questions and sets the stage for Phase 5….

The only possible path for Ghaia in the MCU...,mikekrypton,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b9tjv/the_only_possible_path_for_ghaia_in_the_mcu/,1690483407.0,"Ok...just finished watching Secret Invasion. Here are my thoughts (the last thought relates to the post title):

(****WARNING...SPOILERS IN POST FOR FATWS AND SECRET INVASION)

you have been warned....

1) They should have had Sharon Carter be one of the humans being released from the containment. This would have paid off ""The Power Broker"" twist in FATWS. Even if it was hazy and in the background...it would have been really cool to catch this.

2) To connect it to the greater MCU, the show should have had a post-credit scene of Thadeus Ross (Ford) being the Vice President. 

3) I believe the only path for Ghaia is that, she herself, is The Superskrull (not Gravik) and will be a main villain in an upcoming Avengers movie. Why do you ask? a) she showed invisibility powers like the original Superskrull from the comics. Gravik did not. She kept forming a rock like arm (The Thing?). Also....she is soooooo powerful (I saw some Scarlet Witch and Captain Marvel in her fighting. This would make her either a) an extremely overpowered hero or b) A formidable villain needing multiple heroes to take down.

Just my thoughts. Big Fury fan, so I liked the show a lot. I don't think it did well because people are looking for their favorite heroes to pop up and save the day."

Killing off the character when an actor decides they no longer want to play the characters anymore or the actor might be getting a little long in the tooth seems to be the default. But I think a character like Thor who has lived hundreds of years to suddenly be killed off would not be satisfactory.

My hopes is they go down the All Father King Thor route where he goes back to a revived Asgard to rule and perhaps get married.

We got a rare happy ending with Captain America so something like that would be great and also keeps the door slightly ajar for cameos."

Don't get me wrong, there have been some projects I have loved so far ( Loki, Ms Marvel, Gotg 3). But it really seems like the writing has been getting progressively worse with each project that has been released. 

Sure, the infinity saga has had its fair share of bad writing, but the impact of it in the grand scheme of the MCU wasn't even close compared to now. A movie like Quantumania having bad writing is really going to hurt how people view the multiverse saga, due to it failing to make the main antagonist of the saga feel dangerous. 

Why should we be scared of a villain who lost to an army of ants? Hell, the council of Kangs looks like a complete fucking joke when shown in the post credit scene. 

The MCU really can't afford this trend of bad writing to continue. Especially in projects that are the cornerstone of the multiverse saga."

Not to say there WEREN'T any ideas.  On the contrary, I found many views captivating.

-Skrull Chairperson's ""We did not end up homeless refugees because we were unwilling to wage war.  We ended up homeless refugees because we were too willing.""

-Rhodes' ""The reason we wrestled this power from mediocre men who don't look like us, was not to simply to turn around and hand it to mediocre men who do.""

-Gravik's ""The difference between statesmen and soldiers...""

-Fury's ""Human can't coexist with each other  ...  There is not enough room or tolerance on this planet for another species.""

"As someone who read the Secret Invasion storyline in the comics, the miniseries was sadly underwhelming",staplerbot,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bawdl/as_someone_who_read_the_secret_invasion_storyline/,1690485960.0,"Just to preface this, I didn't hate it. I thought it was okay, with some bright spots, mainly the performances by Sam Jackson, Olivia Coleman and Ben Mendelsohn. I even kind of liked the big dumb Super Skrull fight at the end. However, the storyline in the comics is very expansive, to the point where they could have potentially built up a small phase of the MCU leading into an Avengers: Secret Invasion film.


In the comics, it turns out that many of the world's leaders as well as some major superheroes are revealed to be Skrulls and have been Skrulls for years. It's a startling revelation with major repercussions for the Marvel universe, including the disbandment of SHIELD leading to a replacement agency called HAMMER led by fucking Norman Osborne who then somehow acquires the legal rights to the Avengers, who he then leads (as Iron Patriot) and replaces all of the members with supervillains that still call themselves by the names of the superheroes (for example, Bullseye becomes Hawkeye, Mac Gargon/Venom becomes Spider-Man, Daken becomes Wolverine, etc.). This in turn leads into the Dark Avengers storyline which is what I was expecting the show to potentially lead into.


Just for further clarification, here's some of the major characters that are revealed to be Skrulls:

Hank Pym

Black Bolt

Elektra 

Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)

Jarvis, who is Tony Stark's human butler in the comics

Brother Voodoo

Mockingbird (who is married to Hawkeye in the comics)

Longshot

And then a bunch of Shield agents including Dum Dum Dugan and another person who I won't name in case they are revealed to be a Skrull later.


In the show, it's:


Rhodey

Everett Ross, I guess?


Just a waste of a weird and fun storyline in the comics. They really could have done something fun and interesting with it. Obviously they can't do the whole thing, but it's so watered down that it loses what made it fun in the first place. Civil War didn't resemble the comic version all that much, but at least they boiled it down to its essence, which was two factions that were both kind of right and wrong in their own way, led by Captain America and Iron Man. And it was still very interesting. This was just, there's some Skrulls in this and a few people turn out to be Skrulls and we're calling it Secret Invasion. A bit lazy when you take the source material into account."

I was however quite disappointed because I had very high expectations for that show that had an excellent premise (Nick Fury facing an infiltration of alien shapeshifters on Earth in a spy thriller genre without a ton of superheroes being involved). In the end I found the plot very predictable and quite silly.

But what disappointed me the most was the pointless killing of potentially very good characters..

 
MARIA HILL….  Killed/Fridged summarily for pure shock value at the end of the first episode.. what a waste of a good character and an excellent actress

 

TALOS… Killed/Fridged summarily at the end of the 4th episode (or did he die offscreen between episode 4 and 5). Without even a proper final word.. All the great and interesting build-uphe had until then (I’d say he was arguably the most likeable and “good” character of the show with Varra) gets suddenly put to the ground and incinerated like his body. 

 

I’ll add to these RAAVA aka “Skrhodey”.. Summarily killed by Fury with another head shot (did we get one of those in half of the episodes?). Not many will probably miss him, but I think it is a great missed opportunity not to have had him survive and become a main antagonist against the real Rhodey in Armor Wars. A great challenge for Cheadle to play both characters. And since apparently Rhodey had been replaced for a long time (possibly before Infinity War?) it would have been interesting to see both of them interact with the Avengers (what little is left of them anyway). Skrhodey could have genuinely shared a real camaraderie with his fellow Avengers despite his being secretly an alien impostor while fighting among them against great threats to protect Earth, and gotten a liking to being considered and loved as a hero by the population (a nod to what happens in the original Thunderbolts comics with supervillains posing as superheroes and liking it). On the other hand, at the end of Civil War the real Rhodey was only really friend with the now deceased Tony Stark, and he would have an extremely antagonistic relation with Hawkeye, Antman, Bucky and Sam (now Captain America) considering he fought them and put some of them in jail.. And he might still believe the Sokovia Accords are still justified, all the more now than superhumans can be Skrulls impersonators. A prime possible recruit for the Thunderbolts? At least a good opportunity to have an interesting arc for him..

 

But the saddest assassination for me is not a physical killing, but the character assassination of the main protagonist, NICK FURY himself. 
Fans loved him for being the supreme master spy and strategist, always 3 steps ahead of everyone. 
He is shown as a sad shadow / husk of his former self, supposedly trying to fix his past mistakes without outside help because “it’s personal” but he never has any real plan, except the dumbest one in the finale. I mean, giving the Harvest to the genocidal psychopath Gravik and the inexperienced (and probably still unreliable) G’iah to give them the power to be one of the most powerful beings in the universe, really?

I understand the writers opted to show a washed-out old soldier with PTSD after he was traumatized by the blip, as it could really happen to the strongest ones. I would have gone for that, if at least by the end of the show Fury was shown to have overcome his depression and fatigue, and regained his confidence and efficiency

He has zero accountability and apparently zero remorse for his past mistakes. “Sorry, I tried, but I knew I just could not do it, so I kept lying and using you for my own benefit”.. and he keeps doing it till the end..

He is not really trying to fix the resulting damage and apparently prefers to stay in space on SABER away from the masses and the messes he caused, to supervise his protective planetary shield project (?). He shows little to no empathy to the death of his supposed friends and allies (Hill, Talos..).

Worse of all, the “heroic” (albeit not always very ethical) Nick Fury we thought we knew and loved is practically depicted as a total fraud if not outright villain in the show. 

Both Talos and Gravik accuse him of having used (“pimped”) them for years to do his dirty work for him , taking him to the position of power he now has and letting him get all the credit, without him doing anything for them in return. Something he cannot and does not deny. These secret Skrull operatives really were his dispensable equivalent of the comics’ LMDs all these years, and like a true ruthless and amoral warlord he did not hesitate to send children to assassinate other people with family and kids, psychologically marking them for life and causing them to become psychopaths. These revelations make him much closer to the “darker grey” almost evil version of Fury we get in the Ultimates comics, and some may consider he is not that far from Dreykov and his Black Widow program..

I’m sure some viewers will at least find some redeeming value in his love affair with Varra. But he never was a good husband to her, and it looks to me he was going to abandon her again, if she had not been the one to come and join him at the end..

I’m certain the movie The Marvels will give us back a much more positive and enjoyable characterization of Fury…

On the Lighter side : did anyone “see” the Invisible Woman in Secret Invasion?,Quiet_Effective7234,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b8djo/on_the_lighter_side_did_anyone_see_the_invisible/,1690479976.0,"Obviously I’m not talking about an actual appearance or cameo of Susan Storm, but a possible Easter Egg reference to her in the last episode of SI.

In the scene where Gravik is goading the apparently helpless and sick from radiation “Fury”, he mocks him for not even having a desperate back-up plan like having Avengers on call nearby or using some fancy SHIELD technology gadgets, mentioning specifically a belt providing invisibility and shield (understand forcefield).

These happen to be exactly the main powers of the female member of the Fantastic Four.

And the only powers of that team that had not been previously hinted at in the show (Mr Fantastic = Groot limb extension, HT = Extremis, Thing = Cull Obsidian arm)..

 

Truth be told, in the original comics (of Strange Tales or Nick Fury, agent of SHIELD), Fury was using at some point some vest providing invisibility. 

 

 
But now for the Darker side..

 
Could there be more to it?

The MCU likes to surprise comics fans by switching things around and sometimes reversing roles (cf the way the Skrulls ended up being introduced in Captain Marvel)

 
In the comics, the original Super Skrull, Kl’rt  (Clarity?), obtains his super powers via scientific means allowing him to duplicate and combine those of the F4..

Could the MCU reverse the concept, and have their version of the Fantastic Four actually gain their powers from the Super Skrull(s) already introduced in Secret Invasion?

Imagine the quartet being exposed to mutagenic radiations from a freak incident during an experiment of genius scientist Reed Richards on the recovered body of original Super Skrull Gravik..

The others would not even have to be scientists themselves. Reed might have been convinced by young girlfriend Susan at the insistence of her teen brother Johnny to let them come and see/touch the body of Gravik, despite the reluctance of Reed’s good friend and head of security colonel Ben Grimm. And the accident may be caused by a silly dispute between Johnny and Ben..

It could also explain the origin of the Red Ghost and his Super Apes in the MCU, with brilliant Russian scientist Ivan Kragoff reiterating Richard’s experiment (surely the Russian would also have collected some of Gravik’s DNA from New Skrullos) to endow himself and his trained apes with superpowers also..

Would anyone be ready to accept such a drastic revision of the classic origin story of the Fantastic Four (cosmic raybombardment)? I doubt it..

 
Perhaps interestingly, I vaguely remember some old debate among early fans of the FF comics,with a theory that most the first inventions of Reed Richards were actually not real original creations, but clever understanding/retroengineering/upgrading of recovered alien Skrull technology..

Things we really should point our about secret Invasion so Marvel knows what they did right,bill_buck,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15aofok/things_we_really_should_point_our_about_secret/,1690422282.0,"Things we really should point our about secret Invasion so Marvel knows what they did right

Obviously Secret Invasion was a pretty big letdown, especially eith these final 2 episodes. But there are honestly a couple great things that really should be pointed out, so we can hope marvel won't NOT do them in the future.

1. The Brutalness/violence
The pure violence in this show was honestly so great to see. Starting with the chopping off of a goddamn finger, this show was finally not gonna shy away from violence like other D+ specials, especially like in Moon Knight. People just straight up getting shot in the head, a whole Mortal Kombat on Peyton done by Gravik, etc. were just so good to see.

2. The acting
Obv this isn't really something Marvel can just ""shy away from"" but it's just good to note how good the acting was from everyone, but especially Sonya, Gravik, Fury, and Grava. 

3. The Writing
To be more specific, the writing for scenes just between 2 characters, or dialouge in general. Scenes like Skrodey and Fury at the diner, everything with Sonya, and scenes with Talos and literally anyone else were really just a treat to the eyes."
Multiverse saga,SolitudeShaman,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15au9t4/multiverse_saga/,1690440214.0,"So since we’re going into the multiverse saga, is the ultrom from what if gonna make an appearance in the main universe? 

Like do we only think that the big bad is Kang but in the end it’s going to wrap around to being the ultron from what if who made it to our reality? Is that a possible reason for them adding that new woman for season 2? She doesn’t exist in the mcu but is she going to become mcu canon when ultron finds a way to make to the mcu? 

Also, if he won’t end up being the overarching enemy, do you think he’ll at least team up with kang or maybe even help the avengers fight him in a surprise twist?"

I mean, when Captain America: The Winter Soldier was written, they probably didn't even have the Skrulls in mind for the MCU. S.H.I.E.L.D. and the American government have been infiltrated not just once, but twice – first by Hydra, and then by the Skrulls!

It turns out Fury was using shapeshifting aliens for the past 30 years, making him one heck of a clever strategist to have such advanced assets. You'd think he'd be the best spy in the universe with those resources, right? But here's the kicker – even with all that, he couldn't foresee Hydra's takeover. It's baffling that none of his Skrull spies were able to sniff out Hydra's infiltration.

I have to admit, the show was kind of a letdown, and it did make Fury look a lot worse in my eyes. "

In the next entry Thor has to fight against his own variants because they, like him, tries to save their own universes. The Thor who remains then reaches Chronopolis and meets Loki and Sylvie. They fight and Thor finally puts an end to Loki's schemes. He then rebuilds the TVA and creates a new sacred timeline."

G’iah’s Powers,supernatlove,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b6mox/giahs_powers/,1690475891.0,"So Carol’s powers make most of the other Avengers DNA pretty redundant, but I was trying to figure out her potential power set.

Captain Marvel - Flight, Super Strength, Invulnerability, Power Blasts

Spider-Man - The Peter Tingle

Mantis - Mind Control

Groot- Limb extension 

Those are the ones for sure and the rest were pretty redundant. I did come up with a couple of other possibilities though.

Doctor Strange - Magic if she trains or gains access to the memories of someone who has

Thor - Maybe she can do lightning stuff kind of depends on how much that comes from Thor’s God Status

Hulk - Maybe getting angrier will further strengthen her

Star-Lord - Celestial DNA could maybe do something

Ebony Maw - Telekinesis (put him down here because I wasn’t sure if would’ve been included or not)

"Fury, you’re a problem",DCangst,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b6dev/fury_youre_a_problem/,1690475265.0,"I enjoyed the first part of Secret Invasion… but that finale was the dumbest thing I have seen for marvel in a long time. Even throughout the series, Fury was just doing stupid things. 

When he shot Gavick in the head, for example, and saw that he had Extremis, why stop? Go for a few more head shots.  I thought for sure he’d go round up, whatever Extremis cure Tony had figured out after that.

His repeated refusals to bring in any of the “special people” made no sense. I realize this was a plot device, but I feel like they could’ve come up with something better. It made no sense, for example, in hindsight that he never called Danvers during the battle for New York. I think that qualified as an emergency. I do realize of course captain Marvel hadn’t been made yet. So…it’s just a side note that ties into this decision in a retroactive way.

But here the entire planet is at stake and he says he hast to do this on his own because he can’t rely on them every time something like this happens. It’s the entire planet at stake.  THAT’S WHAT THEY ARE FOR!!!

There were many people he could have called him. One of the Hulks. Hell, Bucky Barnes would have been a logical resource. He’s got super strength and decades of stealth ops. I’d be more resistant to radiation. He could’ve snuck into the complex unseen and taken out Gavick.

I won’t even go into the absurdity of theories decision to handover Avenger DNA, allowing a virtually indestructible creation ( either way) and leaving the entire fate of the world and all human life on it up to the outcome of a fist fight. 

And the scene with the president, theory, and the SIS lady, trying to convince the president that Rhodes was a Skrull when World War III was imminent. Shoot him, cut off a pinky, or hell just pull down his pants. 😂

There was just so much more here but it would be a dissertation.  Even the whole avenger DNA thing made no sense from multiple angles. It’s a shame because I was actually enjoying the series until about the last couple of episodes.

Fury makes bad decisions. He puts the world in jeopardy and creates problems. The whole Skrull thing WAS his fault."

One of the biggest problem of Marvel is that the budget for their projects is way too high,MCUFanFicWriter,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b4dyp/one_of_the_biggest_problem_of_marvel_is_that_the/,1690470557.0,"



Marvel (and Disney in general) clearly has a budgeting problem, as stated by Bob Iger.

Marvel's approach might have worked for a long time, but now they are clearly struggling. 

Their big budgets give them the luxery to do reshoots over and over again and to ""fix everything in post"".

One of the main problems is, however, that the scrips are often rushed. Sometimes the scrips aren't even finished before shooting. 

Having a strong script is incredibly important to get a good final product.

That's why James Gunn's movies are so strong: he is a storyteller first and foremost and makes sure his script is basically set in stone.

Another problem is of course the VFX. VFX workers are overworked because Marvel keeps changing and changing stuff (especially their producers, like Feige) until the last minute.


Lesser budgets would force them to plan their stuff better and would force film makers to be more creative. The studio needs to get their vision straight before they start shooting."

So you were also disappointed in Secret Invasion.

First of all, you could of course read the comics, if you want the true OG Secret Invasion experience. 

But if you want to see the skrull invasion in tv form, them you can watch season 2 of the animated show Avengers: Earth Mightiest heroes, which adapted that whole storyline from the comics quite well. 

But if you want a live action show from Marvel with Nick fury in it, then fear not because Agents of Shield had an arc in season 4 which tackles the whole ""who can you trust"", ""people who look like your friends"" etc, and it did it say better then Secret Invasion, even though that was just one arc and Secret Invasions whole premise was that. 

So there's some suggestions, do you guys have any more?"

It feels safe to say that at the very least Marvel content is mixed in quality but at an all time low with regards to public reception.

I was hoping that with the announcement that Phase 4 ends with BP:WF, that Phase 5 would be beginning of the quality MCU again. But so far we’ve had a mixed bag &gt;!(2 flops and 1 hit)!&lt;.

It seems safe to infer that everything in post-production now may still suffer from the (post-)pandemic, vfx, and over saturated MCU mess we are currently in (I view the strikes as something that I hope will improve future MCU content). Does this realistically mean we shouldn’t really expect a majority of MCU quality except for the content in pre-production? I know little regarding how movies/tv-shows are made. But I’d imagine that by the filming stage, it’s largely difficult to fix core problems with the content if say something like the story/writing is lackluster.

So looking at the current pipeline, the earliest MCU projects that have not begun filming are Thunderbolts, Blade, and F4. So back to my initial question, does this mean that we shouldn’t really expect the “quality” MCU content until the very earliest, Thunderbolts?

Provision: I am not suggesting that items currently in production/post-production cannot be good. I am more suggesting that these same products will still largely suffer from potentially poor writing, rushed schedule, etc.

Personal aside: So with the upcoming MCU projects that are filming or in post, here are the projects that I hope and expect to be good: Loki Season 2, X-Men 97, What If…? season 2, Deadpool 3

What I expect to be bad but I hope will be good: The Marvels, Echo, Ironheart, Agatha, Daredevil: Born Again, CA:BNW"

1. Who is the audience for this?  
2. Will this be profitable on its own?
3. If not, how will this assist in other profits?
4. Is it necessary to the larger story?

So let's compare and contrast *Moon Knight* versus *Ms. Marvel.*

*Moon Knight*:

1. The audience is comic fans who know this B-tier character and those who will watch anything marvel.  Also Oscar Isaac fans.
2. Nope. On a streamer, no direct profits.
3. May or may not be a reason people subscribed to Disney+
4. Did not establish any solid ties to MCU that require future use of this character.  Does not lead to anything yet.

*Ms. Marvel*:

1. In addition to MCU fans generally, and fans of the comic (which I also consider a B-tier character), it expands the reach into the Pakistani and Indian communities; this character opens a market.
2. Nope; again, no direct profits tied to a streaming show.
3. This is where the magic happens; with the large popularity and the direct lead-in to *The Marvels*,  this was basically both entertainment and a $200M lead-in property to a large franchise film.  So this helps profits in 2 ways ... it increases Disney+ profits by making it required viewing for before the movie, and hopefully hooks more people into the movie in general release.
4. Well, it appears to be ... it at least becomes important for one big movie, and is bringing in multiple characters they intend to use (I hope) a lot.

Did I like *Moon Knight*?  Absolutely.  But it didn't pull its weight with the MCU ... minimal acknowledgment of MCU relevance and a self-contained story ... It didn't try for the heavy lifting that *Ms. Marvel* accomplished."

That finale had to have been one of the worst things I have ever witnessed. It felt like the show had no passion or effort put into it and felt somewhat rushed. If every Marvel show going forward is going to have this kind of quality or even worse, then the MCU is doomed unless they stop making these shows and focus on quality over quantity.

Now, if you understand the history of the Inhumans even a little, you understand why I might suggest this. Bringing in the Inhumans during this period of &gt;! maximum alien hostility !&lt; sets them up as the individuals to be hated and feared by the populace from outside humanity. Following this, I think the X-Men would have an even stronger entry into the world.

There's one of two ways the X-Men get set up in the MCU. Either they're the premier version of the School for Gifted Youngsters and we get the story of all the X-people growing up in the mansion, or the MCU decides to do things the hard way and implement Hickman's Krakoa Era as the foundation. Either one works here. I'm doing a lot of theory-writing, but I'm basically saying now is a good time for the Inhumans to pop up, and then subsequently, the X-Men can show up after &gt;! substantial doubt has been shown about what exactly can be classified as alien !&lt;.

"Secret Invasion was fine, but too short and may end up being the most disappointing Disney+ series so far.",JMRanger1,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15aal1j/secret_invasion_was_fine_but_too_short_and_may/,1690389179.0,"In my view, Secret Invasion wasn't a bad show and had some great moments in there but ultimately fell short in a way that may make it the most disappointing series so far. I think that's because it asked the audience to take the show very seriously, when you go into a show like say She-Hulk you expert a procedural law-comedy flick and so your expectations are set to match but this sold itself as a high-stakes, dramatic, spy-thriller with comparisons made to The Winter Soldier and Andor, resulting a bar too high for it to reach.

However, while that's why it may feel disappointing, it's not the reason the show couldn't hit that bar. Secret Invasion in total, wasn't even 5 hours long with only 6 episodes which once again, turned out to be far too short to build up a show with this many layers. There were so many characters and plot lines that needed more time to be fleshed out, so much potential in the Skrulls dynamic that needed more development on screen.

Marvel needs to change their current mini-series formula, some of these shows need more episodes with longer runtimes, while others could have been special presentations and to be fair, it looks like moving forward with new productions Marvel is doing this. Daredevil is going to have a crazy 18 episodes! while Armor Wars has been shortened down, becoming a movie instead so overall, we can be hopeful for future series learning these lessons."

Secret Invasion wasn’t bad **SPOILERS**,JuggernautQueasy8405,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bcbtn/secret_invasion_wasnt_bad_spoilers/,1690489259.0,"Secret Invasion wasn’t bad **SPOILERS**

I’m a little shocked that the general consensus seems to be that Secret Invasion was bad. Sure, it could’ve been much better, and it did seem like too large of a comic storyline to just have a couple characters and episodes. But I thought that it overall was enjoyable to watch, and I had a good time with it. 

I also really enjoyed the “Rhodey” stuff. I know it will upset some people that he has been a skrull for some time now, probably before Endgame. But after thinking about it, it sounds interesting to see Rhodey actually deal with the fallout of Endgame (tony’s death, Armor Wars stuff), because it felt like he was sidelined for a while after being a main character. Hell, we’ve seen more of Happy’s trauma and thoughts than Rhodey’s. If done right, it could make for some great content. 

Secret Invasion felt different at the least than most other MCU shows/movies recently, even if it didn’t completely stick the landing.  

Am I weird for thinking this or do others agree? Thoughts?"
My Opinion on Secret Invasion,Frequent-Cost2184,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15au85z/my_opinion_on_secret_invasion/,1690440054.0,"Now, I would like to start this post by saying that I would’ve not posted this, if I didn’t see so many negative opinions abt the series especially the last episode which really came to me as a surprise. 

I would like to add that I am not some expert in movies, and not even a marvel expert, I am just a guy who watches MCU, and generally knows the characters, their backstories and follow it relatively closely.

I think that the show was great, did it have its flaws? Absolutely, ofc it did. One of them being for example that with Rhodey being an Avenger, he could’ve easily called them to Gravik. But this shouldn’t be a reason to say that the show is ass. Many of the complaints was that it was slow and the climax wasn’t coming as fast as ppl would’ve wanted, but I personally think it was ok, at the end of the day they were trying to explain about a long story of aliens creatures who worked for Fury for decades as spies and now suddenly they don’t like him, you need to slowly introduce/integrate them into the MCU. I also saw some say that this movie added nothing to the MCU, which is in my humble opinion is little bit, tiny bit wrong to say at least, the movie ends with that there is a war against all alien form on Earth, the president didn’t specify Skrulls only, so it did in fact added lot to the MCU, saying that Secret Invasion didn’t bring anything to the MCU is like saying Civil War didn’t bring anything to the MCU

Another complaint was abt the last episode being like a big fat L to this whole show, (insert fail trombone sound effect here) type stuff, which I also kinda disagree, movie ended on a very good note, we got Giah into the MCU and with her abilities she is a superb character(remember we going toward the battle against the army of Kangs)

Would like conclude on this, I would like to add at the end that, with this post I don’t mean to offend anyone, if u disagree that’s 100% fine and this why this post was made, to discuss a show"

As far as Armor Wars is concerned, a rejuvenated Rhodey/War Machine will team up with Riri Williams/Ironheart to take on a team of Ultrons. This team of Ultrons will be assembled to eliminate Skrulls on Earth. But some AI mess-up will end up them being a threat to everyone."

Like in 'Falcon and the Winter Soldier,' 'She-Hulk,' and 'Secret Invasion.' And honestly, it's cool when it's about species-based powers or those serum-induced ones, makes sense those could be passed on through blood. 

But what stumps me is when you think about powers like Ghost's. Is quantum-based, so how on earth do they get tangled up with blood? Sure, one could say these powers got themselves entangled at a quantum level, but I just can't buy that they can be copied through biological stuff.

Then there's Captain Marvel. Her power is all about cosmic energy from the Tesseract, so how does that connect to blood? And if you think about Wanda... If you cloned her, it's not like the clone would start throwing around Chaos magic instantly. Wanda had to learn that stuff, didn't she? ( Or maybe she didn't? I don't know, I haven't read the comics. )  


 The way I see it, these powers are more about what's happening outside the body than anything to do with blood or genes. Did I miss a memo, or are there others who feel the same?"

I did a rewatch of the entire MCU recently and while pretty much all of the casting is good to great, Downey Jr. is just in a league all on his own. Even in the ensemble crossovers or when he's basically a cameo it's just night and day compared the other leading men and women. I get that most of that is down to sheer technical experience and I notice some of the others namely Hemsworth, Holland, Stan and Mackie beginning to catch up; he still stands out among Academy darlings like Hopkins and Nyong'o. 

My particular favourite scenes that have stuck with me for years are the ""there is only the next mission""/""I shouldn't have survived"" scene where Pepper threatens to quit in Iron Man (2008), both the Charlie Spencer scenes in Civil War with his surviving mother and with the Avengers at the compound, with Fury in Clint's barn (also my favourite Sam Jackson Fury scene btw), the hilarious strapped to a bedframe threatening the guards scene in Iron Man 3 and so many others. 

I will say one of the weaker ones was in the first Avengers , but that's not due to Downey's performance I just felt that Tony in that movie was written just a _pinch_ out of character from his previous 2 appearances for the teamup movie arc to work well. Just a little bit. Not enough to ruin the movie or anything.. he was just a little more bullish especially in his first scenes. He was definitely narcissistic and arrogant from the previous two films but he wasn't bullish to the extent of the Whedon movie. It was a little like Cheadle's Rhodey was in the suit sometimes."

Here where I think it could be:


1. That this could lead to another terrorist faction of skrulls that become sympathize to gravik beliefs of wiping out the humanity

Now there’s absolutely some shitty things in the finale so I’ll address those first. Skrull Rhodeys trying to convince the president that it was Russia was hilariously bad “it’s Russia Mr president, it’s Russia she’s dumb it’s russia because I said so, she has a perfectly reasonable explanation but it’s russia kill them now!” That was one of the worst scenes in the mcu. 

And then them not actually telling us how long rhodey was a skrull for us complete bs, they literally ask how long have you been in there and then it gets a vague “a very long time” answer. Wtf is that? Fuck you tell me when. 

But the rest of the episode is goddamn amazing and fixes most of the issues with the show. 

Two super skrulls fighting having all of the mcu’s powers? That was freaking awesome! I saw some people complaining that it’s not accurate to super skrull in the comics and yea so? Neither is anything else in this show, not a single superhero (unless you count rhodey) is a skrull. 

Is it an arbitrary way to give them powers? Yes but do you think a tesseract explosion or radioactive spider bite isn’t, hell with cap didn’t they just randomly pick him because he seemed like a good dude. But this vial giving them powers is somehow more crazy? 

Not to mention that the writing with fury and his wife is great this episode. It makes perfect sense for her to not want to go with him but when he finally accepts her for who she is she is willing to forgive him and give him a second chance.

Plus this fixes the WORST issue with the whole show being that almost nothing happened in every episode at least until the end. This episode always has something going on and sets up a lot for the future, a super skrull that’s good, possibly bringing back a bad super skrull but that’s a little less likely, a skrull war/genocide, a peace treaty between the skrull and kree. 

Now the rest of the show was pretty rough. I wouldn’t be surprised if episodes 2-5 got the worst ratings but this episode? This one is definitely the best by a mile."

People's expectations and ridiculous theories werent met, and they are mad, yet again. People need to learn to enjoy and story and not try and predict every crazy wild idea. 

The ending is still leading to more and more stories that expand the MCU.

- Ritson is a straight up jerk that uses fear to spread hysteria and leads to innocent people being attacked (sounds familiar...)
- the UK now works with Giah and is one of, if not the strongest characters in the mcu
- Fury says peace talks have started with the kree......and WHO just happens to be in the very next movie of The Marvels? The kree and Fury
- the new Captain America movie is formally know as New World Order..... and it makes even more sense WHY.  Now that's its Brave New World it will be about combating the horrible, one term presidency, of Ritson and his stain on the world

This story isn't over, and like classic MCU,  it's leading to more MCU stories

Was it the biggest series in the world, no. But it had story aspects that spread through the entire MCU and it will be exciting to what it leads to"
List of Concrete Problems with Secret Invasion,pachakutiqoulson,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15arke6/list_of_concrete_problems_with_secret_invasion/,1690431386.0,"1. Marvel already did a tense spy-thriller with Nick Fury! And it made way more sense bc the question was a question of allegiance, something you can’t easily see, unlike skrulls who can just be injured or killed to reveal their true form. This concept was doomed from the start.

2. To makeke the concept even more doomed, it completely abandoned the comics storyline, which could’ve pulled in the second most popular character from Marvel TV.

3. Fury spends the whole time talking, very little spy stuff, literally 0 surprising skrull reveals

4. Killed off two popular characters who didn’t have huge parts in the MCU but were fan favorites anyway, who could’ve had a good future

5. No tension built up before revealing the super skrull machine, no interesting transformation scene, very little usage of actual super skrull powers

6. Make two characters insanely OP as the climax, breaking 15 years of precedent (how are Ghost’s powers a DNA thing? Or Captain Marvel’s? Isn’t Giah the most powerful being in the universe now? And Fury just lets her go?). Then make their fight under 5 minutes long before one kills the other. Gravik could’ve easily flew away, but didn’t. The whole thing is way too easy and convenient.

6a. The other half of the climax was stupid, Sonya could’ve easily killed Skrhodey for that whole time. 

7. Introduced too many new characters, we don’t care about any of them (we only like Sonia bc of Colman’s acting, not story reasons). This story should’ve been told with skrulls messing with our favorite characters. 

8. ***Killing the bad guy actually doesn’t resolve the plot…. where are the rest of the skrulls? Seems like Fury just abandoned them. He didn’t even tell the President that a Skrull saved the day! Not satisfying at all.*** definitely no moral message or lesson learned here.

9. The villain is so shallow, 1-dimensional, and flat out stupid that it’s hard to stay engaged in the story. He could’ve killed Fury in the attack on the president and didn’t. He criticizes power-hungry humans and then immediately makes himself supreme skrull ruler. He kills his own people! It makes no sense!

10. So short! Yet somehow repetitive: 3 out of 6 episodes end with a death, 4 if you include gravik. And a lot of those problems could’ve been alleviated with more breathing room for the side characters, or side-plots built up with skrull-reveals later.

11. For Agents of SHIELD fans, it was a one-two punch: Fury didn’t call Coulson or Daisy, and the S4 LMD arc did this same thing 1000x better with a way smaller budget.

12. They showed us super interesting ideas in the last few minutes montage. Actual war between disguised skrulls and soldiers, confused vigilantes, general chaos, political tension, all could’ve been explored but were mitigated to 2 minutes at the end. 

Super disappointing for such a great comics arc. What else should be on the list?"

Why this saga feels disconnected,U2106_Later,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ariyo/why_this_saga_feels_disconnected/,1690431272.0,"Honestly, I do get the criticism that things feel disconnected in these phases. Previous phases felt more tied together, if for nothing else than the fact that there were less projects to tie, period. With all of the new D+ shows, they needed to be more consistent and explicit. I think the studio has bit off more than they can chew with the amount of threads they are tackling.

&amp;#x200B;

Every project from phases 4 and 5 can basically be sorted into three categories: follow-ups, new stuff, and multiverse stuff.

Follow-ups are the projects that focus on the aftermath of the previous saga. I would say this includes Far From Home, TFatWS, WandaVision, Hawkeye, Secret Invasion, and Wakanda Forever. I'd also put Love and Thunder and the holiday special in this category. Here we have a consistent theme: addressing the consequences of the Blip, moving on from the deaths and loss of the previous films, and passing the torch to new heroes. To match this theme I'd throw She-Hulk in as well.

For new stuff, Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, Echo, the Marvels, Born Again, Eternals, Shang-Chi, Ironheart, Blade, Fantastic Four. Eternals and Shang-Chi are kind of in-between this and the previous category since they both deal with Blip fallout.

Multiverse stuff is obvious: Loki, What If, MoM, Quantumania, and No Way Home. To me the biggest issue with this is that we don't have the in-between tissue for this and the second category (at least, not yet, but we should *already have it*)

&amp;#x200B;

They really should have sorted each category out into its own phase. I could see Phase 4 consisting of the projects in the follow-up category, perhaps concluding with WandaVision to tie it into the overarching saga, then start introducing more characters in Phase 5 as we branch out more into the universe. Transition into explicit multiverse stuff late in phase 5/entering phase 6. Throughout we can sprinkle in projects like Armor Wars, Guardians 3, etc. that don't necessarily connect to the main theme or introduce new ideas, but are good for rounding out the lineup. The nice thing is that since a lot of these films don't reference each other, they can probably be watched in any order, so a change to the viewing order can make it feel more cohesive.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if the plan was originally closer to this before the pandemic shifted things around."

Absolutely incredible!

However,
It seems that the most popular posts here on Reddit say it's the biggest garbage that the MCU had ever generated.

To each and their own opinions, but now, especially after all the other hate the MCU, and, by extension, several other media franchies out there goet on Reddit even though I really really like them,
Especially after all of the human psychology that I learned,
I have come to the conclusion that there's a high high probability that Redditors specifically and internet users in general either post more hate for something than love, because hating something drives and motivates you more into sharing about it with others than love, and also, hate is a very good way to attract people to your posts for popularity rather than love,
Or they see these other people hating on a thing and they just don't wanna fall behind this supposed popular trend that seems popular and common because of all the reasons mentioned above.

So yeah,
Thank you Reddit for finally making my heart realize the lesson of not having to feel bad if my opinion seemingly isn't fit with what the rest of the internet says and to not base my entire way of deciding what to watch and what not to watch on what the internet says about it. Perhaps I should base just some of it but not all of it.
I say my heart because it's been extended even further than being a cognitive ideology to go by, because my emotions have been corrupted by it for so long, which actually makes sense because the internet is a good source of social pressure and, as social creatures, humans have developed and evolved so that our emotions are heavily based on social interactions and norms.

And I'm not just saying all of this for no reason,
I'm posting about all of this so that perhaps at least some of the readers of this post might relate to it too and it might fit their internet lives too. Basically, I'm saying that this post might help other like it helped me.

But besides all of that,
Yeah,
The latest episode was awesome as fuck and it has built up The Marvels to be even more exciting than it was for me before!
And I hope we see Emilia Clarke as G'iah again in future MCU projects, not only because of her brand new and incredible superpowers, but just because I am now officially putting her as one of the coolest and interesting characters of the entire MCU!
Well, perhaps that is a little extreme,
But what I'm trying to say is that I love her character now very much! 🥰 lol"
Shorter duration of episodes is even more bothering than the general available quantity.,[deleted],7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a5gvj/shorter_duration_of_episodes_is_even_more/,1690377012.0,"While there have been complaints and criticisms regarding the six episodes structure, I believe that the duration of said episodes is also equally weakening the narrative.

It's been a common pattern from the start where episodes mostly have only been of half an hour to 40 minutes. Occasionally a few strech to 50 minutes and Hawkeye's last is the only that I can remember to have gone for a proper hour.

Not to forget that these shows are also just trying to adjust too much into a single season which remains half-baked and isn't entirely developed either. I personally feel that I can accept six episodes but it also needs to shorten the sub-plots enough that the season can adjust and have longer episodes. 

This is just a little piece and I'd like your insights on the same."
"New Daredevil Reliable Rumours Reveal Series' Structure, Villain and new status for Matt Murdock",KostisPat257,860,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15952cn,1690282470.0,"The series will be released in 2 9-episode parts with a short gap in-between each part and a different overarching plot for each part (think of Agents of SHIELD Season 4's pods). Muse will be the main villain of the first part.

What's more, the show will do small 2-3 episode arcs like Andor with each arc focusing a relatively standalone plot with all plots coming together at the end.

Finally, Nikki M. James' Kirsten McDuffie will be one of Matt's new law partners at his new ""Matthew Murdock and Partners"" law firm. Nelson and Murdock (and Page) is no more. 

It's been reported in the past by reliable leakers that Elden Henson has shot some scenes as Foggy, but Foggy and Karen will be mostly absent from the series and there will be a plot reason to justify their absence.

The series will deal with Fisk running for NYC mayor, a plot point which will first be introduced in Echo, with his campaign focusing on crashing NYC's vigilantes such as Daredevil, The Punisher, Spider-Man and Kate Bishop/Hawkeye with the first 2 appearing in the series, trying to stop Fisk.

Additionally, there's a rumour that an event of Daredevil Season 1 will be directly mentioned in the series and another event of the Netflix Daredevil Series will be shown in a flashback in Echo, making the Netflix series unequivocally canon.

And finally, the events of the series are rumoured to lead directly into Spider-Man 4 where Spidey and Daredevil will team up to stop Kingpin and some super-powered goons he has hired in order to take down the city's vigilantes.

To which Rhodes replies that neither was he, but they ""work with what they've got.""

It just struck me as a disproportionate comparison, as Nebula was referring to the extensive cybernetic augmentations to which she was subjected by her abusive adoptive father, which she sustained as a child through to her adulthood; procedures which were involuntary and which let her scarred physically, psychologically, and emotionally.

But ***now***, following the events of *Secret Invasion*, where we learn that &gt;!the Rhodey we've known since the outcome of Civil War has (most likely) been a Skrull!&lt;, it casts his comments in a **completely different light**.

When he says that he ""wasn't always like this,"" he's not referring to his paraplegia or the exoskeleton that gives him use of his legs--**he's referring to the fact that** &gt;!he wasn't always Colonel James Rhodes, an identity and likeness he's only wearing as part of an assignment (and which he has no idea is about to turn into a five-year performance)!&lt;. With this in mind, it adds a radically different dimension to his comments when he says, ""But we work with what we've got, right?""

Just something that occurred to me, given what we learn (or at least, what's heavily implied) during *Secret Invasion*'s (otherwise disappointing) finale today.

Thoughts on mcu power levels and overall movies,Every_Scientist_5620,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15adm83/thoughts_on_mcu_power_levels_and_overall_movies/,1690396015.0,"Lately I've been feeling that mcu is kinda setting itself for failure with it's latest entries.

I've always liked their movies, even when they (admittedly) got a little to much on the woken side of things.

That been said, the sheer number of superheroes with drastically different power levels have been, imo, diminishing the overall quality of the movies.

It's pretty hard to get on the edge of the seat when you know that most of the latest entry problems might be easily dealt with by a handful of other reachable superheros.

Not only that, but a lot of the already established superheros get greatly diminished by a ever growing group of progressively stronger characters (some of them borderlining fanfiction characters, with almost every power in the hands of just one person).

I realize that most of them (or all) probably have a comic book basis, and that a bigger cast also mean an expanding universe, bigger battles, more empowerment and space to approach different cultures and important topics(all extremally valid points).

But, as a casual spectator, I wonder if by trying to embrace everything, they're spreading theirselfs to thin and effectively trading off a lot of the core values of the movie, like building tension with real stakes, creating a genuine emocional bond with the characters and leaving satisfying arcs for their overall story.

This thoughs are really not meant to enrage anyone, and I imagine I could be wrong with a lot of it... So, sorry if I offended you and please leave your thoughts so I can better understand what I got wrong."

Secret Invasion's original sin was Marvel trying to make Skrulls sympathetic in the first place.,rdhight,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ar7r4/secret_invasions_original_sin_was_marvel_trying/,1690430352.0,"Lots of things are wrong with Secret Invasion, but it was always behind the 8-ball because of the MCU's insistence, starting with Capt. Marvel, that we should feel sorry for Skrulls, sympathize with Skrulls, view Skrulls as some messed-up X-Men-like social-issues allegory.

That was always a mistake. Skrulls should just have always been treated as a threat. That would have set up Secret Invasion for success. Not *guaranteed* success, but it would have been in a much better position."

This makes me kind of suspicious because they may not have mentioned how she was killed because she may be alive. Also, it was rumored that there would be a heart breaking skrull reveal in SI. What if this is it?

If Soren is alive, one theory that I do have is that she might be impersonating Shirley Sagar who was a part of the skrull council. Shirley was featured in episode 2 and she was the women who decided to resign from the skrull council. Of course this theory is probably a huge stretch. But I'm really curious to know what your thoughts are on this theory before the final episode of SI comes out."

I had some fun with the finale, but I think ultimately, for a show that I felt started *very* strong, it kinda just ended up falling flat. I never felt that the show was *bad*, I think it just went from amazing to just okay. Which is definitely not ideal, and that’s why the show definitely lands somewhere in the bottom half of my rankings. 

But for a few reasons, I actually think that the show set up the future of the MCU in a really cool way and after seeing the whole show, I’m more excited for the future. 

It definitely felt like some plot threads were left untouched in the finale (or brushed over). But I do think that The Marvels will pick up on those, or at least some of them. And if they can resolve those in The Marvels, I think it could retroactively make this show a little bit better. 

Also, having this be the focus for Carol’s character arc (everything that has to do with skrulls from Captain Marvel to Secret Invasion to The Marvels) I think will make her arc a lot stronger. I think if The Marvels allows Brie Larson to truly be herself in the performance (which it appears so from the trailers), then she’s gonna feel so much more natural and could potentially come out on top as a true leader, especially with the skrull plot line in the background. 

And finally, there’s Rhodey. Everyone’s all up in arms because he’s potentially been a skrull since the end of Civil War/the beginning of Infinity War. I actually think it’s genius, even if a few moments are cheapened. I think it adds a level of stakes knowing that someone you loved was a skrull. And thank God this wasn’t an Avengers movie because then you’d get like 4 or 5 Avengers that were revealed to be skrulls and then everyone would *really* be up in arms. But given that Rhodey hasn’t had his own project yet in the MCU, I think he was the perfect choice. It doesn’t matter who they chose, people would still be pissed.

Anyway, don’t wanna get sidetracked, but I think that Rhodey having been out of commission for that long sets up a *really cool* character arc for him that can be explored in Armor Wars. That will allow them to really dig deep into his character in that film and I’m really excited about that. 

TLDR: Even after a slightly lackluster final episode or two, Secret Invasion got me so much more excited for movies like The Marvels and Armor Wars."

I say this because well the first half of Phase 5 were being written the time Marvel was still being on the Quantity over Quality phase.

The amount of quantity and projects being released in Phase 4 was just so much and the writers and the VFX team wasn't given the proper time to perfect it.

How Phase 5 is going, I have a feeling Phase 5 (The first half at least) is going to suffer the same fate as Phase 4.

Secret Invasion felt rushed and the story was bland, it was okay but the potential was wasted. 

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was suppose to be a great start for Phase 5 but it didn't live up to the hype of being the first project of the Phase, contributes to the Multiverse Saga and how dangerous Kang is. 

The Marvels, Echo, Loki S2, Agatha: Coven of Chaos, Iron Heart, Captain America 4, we're written during the time Phase 4 was still releasing content meaning the writers were not given time and were rushed to finish it. 

Now that Marvel is doing Quality over Quantity the CGI is gonna be good but would the story be the same quality as the CGI? We do not know. 

Now projects like Born Again, Blade, The Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Avengers The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars and other untitled Phase 6 projects has the potential to be good because the writers are finally given the chance and time to finish it.

If they're not into it, that's okay but, you're not a ""fan"" that should have a large say in the Fandom. Instead, you're a conditional-fan that likes some bits but, not others.

Doing this has made me want to continue on with my MCU marathon and once I’ve watched the remaining movies, to make a start on the tv shows. 

The only movies I haven’t seen so far are: 
- Black Widow
- Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
- Eternals
- Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
- Thor: Love and Thunder
- Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
- Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania

Apart from: The Punisher - Which is one of my favourite shows of all time and in my opinion I’ve never seen a character be so well played by an actor in anything! Jon Bernthal is a real one. 

Daredevil: Another one of my favourite TV shows! Exceptional from start to finish! 

So my question is where do I start! Are there some shows you’d give a miss completely? 

Is it important to watch a specific show before you watch another one? 

What are your favourite / least favourite shows?

My current list for TV shows is: 

- Agent Carter 
- Agents of Shield 
- Wandavision 
- Loki 
- The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 
- Hawkeye 
- Secret Invasion 

The rest are put on the “maybe” list! 

Granted this kind of question has probably been asked a million times and could be deemed a pointless ask but when your investing so much time to a tv series / multiple series it’s nice to get others opinions.

The MCU should Quit the Sagas…,rabooca,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15abxho/the_mcu_should_quit_the_sagas/,1690392234.0,"I feel the MCU should quit doing sagas because it’s becoming clearer and clearer by each instalment that 98% of these characters and storylines are never going to be revisited so you just end up wasting everybody’s time.

Also finally Marvel has all the characters and brands back under one umbrella but yet for some reason Marvel still thinks it’s a good idea to have a overarching story. Well as you can see with phase 4-5 the MCU is just way too big to maintain a QUALITY single continuous storyline as (with help of the Disney plus shows) most projects just seem like they are going nowhere. Another reason why I feel they should stop the sagas is because after secret wars we’re likely switching over to the x-men and that would be aptly called the ‘Mutant Saga’ but what does that even mean bc the mutant mythology is a whole other can of worms that could easily exist by themselves by I digress.

To conclude,I highly recommend and I’ve been feeling this way for a while that MCU should focus on CORNERS of the Marvel Universe like the Cosmic,Mystic,Supernatural,
Fantastic Four,Street Level,Avengers,X-men and so on and so forth and then every once in a while a majority could come all together to fight a common enemy 

Anyways,that’s just how I feel would love to know you’re opinions!"

I know that we now have this sloppily dovetailed thematic idea of 'endless possibilities' in the form of the skrulls, multiverses, and branched timelines, but I have zero clue as to what the narrative arcs are and whose story I'm invested in.

Now, not all of this is Marvel's fault since we can't deny that COVID, Chadwick Boseman, and Jonathan Majors real-world events certainly have an effect on what directions the story has taken, not to mention the fact that actors who came aboard in the later half of the Infinity Saga are at this awkward stage where their characters have gone through deep emotional arcs, but they're at weird points in this overall story, and those actors aren't necessarily looking to keep doing Marvel stuff forever. But the way this story is being told, not to mention Disney's treatment of writers and animators has given me enough reason to say that they can't really chalk up sub-par stories to extenuating circumstances anymore.

At the beginning of Phase 4, I was really intrigued by the potential setup of Wanda and Loki as main characters for this next phase. I loved the idea of using this theme of endless possibility and allowing two misfit characters from the previous saga have their time to shine and lead the narrative here. 

Even though Season 2 of Loki is on the way, the way the the story is being told so far just seems so out of balance. Consequences aren't felt throughout the shared universe, but individual stories don't even feel that compelling enough to justify being in their self-contained lanes.

I'm really curious to see what this whole thing looks like when it's done, but right now, I just see a mess. "

You take it all for granted, even as DC continues to make mistake after depressingly hilarious mistake with their own cinematic universe. *You do not appreciate what you have.* You expect every Marvel product to outperform the last, setting unreasonably high expectations and endlessly nitpicking each and every possible aspect of the MCU. It’s always been popular to hate whatever is popular, but the past few years have seen this to a completely unfair degree. *Secret Invasion* would have been praised had it been released even just ten years ago, but now it’s apparently garbage because you all expect it to be as good, if not better, than *Avengers: Endgame*. You have forgotten how to just relax and fucking *enjoy* something. But no, it has to be *perfect* now. I swear, you people genuinely enjoy hating Marvel, like you smell blood in the water.

(FF4 Introduction) The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to an emergency beacon of a spaceship that has reappeared after being lost for decades.

I feel that Marvel has painted itself into a corner with the Fantastic Four’s introduction. There are really only a few ways of introducing them. One is that the team will be from another universe. Two, they have been lost in the Quantum Realm, and three,  they are lost in time. I know there are probably other options, but these seem like the most feasible.

I would prefer an introduction that avoids the Eternals problem where the team has been in hiding the whole team and did not help in world-threatening events. Also, the Multiverse, being the answer to this, feels cheap. Time travel is tricky, so here is a fun option.

*The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to an emergency beacon that suddenly appears on their scopes. On investigation, they find a decades-old spaceship from Earth containing the cryo-sleeping bodies of Four scientists who were long believed to be lost and dead. Once awakened, the crew explains that during their mission, a catastrophic event happened, dosing them in radiation, and they went into cryo-sleep to save themselves, hoping that when they were found, they could be saved. But instead of killing them, the radiation changed them.*

*The scientists come back to earth and discover that they have been gone for a while, and their newly formed powers could help a world made vulnerable by the loss of the core Avengers.*"
Missed opportunities for Fury’s use of Skrulls in SHIELD?,Quiet_Effective7234,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159fo8c/missed_opportunities_for_furys_use_of_skrulls_in/,1690307563.0,"Obviously having Skrull shapeshifter agents would have greatly helped Fury and SHIELD on the field to collect intelligence, both for simple reconnaissance missions behind enemy lines (easy to blend in and escape discretely when you can take anyone’s form and have a universal translator) and for deeper undercover infiltration (impersonating someone after stealing their memories to get to the head of the target organization and sabotage its plans).

But that field work is not the only way Skrulls could have help an early stage SHIELD. 

Their technology would have been very useful, making the organization less dependent on Stark Industries.

The Fracking pod, that machine used by the Skrulls not only to upload memories into another person but also to display them for all to see (as witnessed at the beginning of Captain Marvel) would have been a fantastic tool for a spy agency to retrieve secrets. Much more practical, humane and certainly more reliable and efficient than using torture to obtain information from prisoners and suspects, unless you are a sadist at heart.. 

And in the process of screening candidates for higher positions inside SHIELD (and government?) to quickly check if they are not a double agent, it would be waaaay more trustworthy than an outdated polygraph lie-detector, albeit certainly not that ethical (but would you expect SHIELD to care?).. If you think about it, that Skrull Fracking technology allowing the display of memories would actually be a relatively easy way to expose Skrull impostors…

I’m definitely not trying to restart with this the heated (quite pointless imho) debate I recently saw about Fury’s alleged incompetence for not having been able to discover Hydra’s control of SHIELD when he had Skrull spies working for him. Let’s just say the few Skrulls who were working for Fury at that time (Winter Soldier film) did not yet have a Fracking machine brought to Earth (one would not have been enough anyway)..

 

Apart from the espionage world, the Fracking machine could also have an interesting use in a legal court to prove the innocence or guilt of an accused party, at least in the countries that would agree to have that invasive alien technology admissible in court. That could be a interesting point for a She-Hulk case..

Sure, losing him might be problematic for recreating the serum, but they already had his blood.

Disregarding the outcome for recruitment (which they might have anticipated, but not known prior to the Senator stepping in), it seems that his newfound abilities would be useful, if in a very directed approach, rather than a footsoldier.

Edit: for clarification, I’m not asking about any making other super soldiers. That’s been addressed so many times in the shows and movies. I’m asking about why no one above Phillips thought a single super human soldier could have been useful in the war effort on the ground rather than as a PR stunt."

I was so stoked because I had heard great things. No spoilers, but just rave reviews about the movie. I finally watched it a few nights ago and haven't been so let down in a long time. I'll say, I put my phone down and focused on just the movie, so it's not like I missed anything. I watched it in its entirety. 

Let me start by saying Adam Warlock was a disappointment. I was excited for him to be in the franchise after GotG2, but this movie made him a puny side character.

The High Evolutionary was a temperamental scientist, not a big bad. After Ego, he just seems like a bargain bin villain.

That's another thing, no main character was ever in an real danger. Drax was fine after getting shot, the Abilisks ""only eat batteries""...with their sharp teeth.

I get what they were doing there for the story, but why did the writers feel the need to put those kids in the movie? I hate when a sense of urgency is needed so writers throw ""helpless kids"" into the situation. It's an overused trope in any movie. (Looking at you Love and Thunder)

There was way too much fluffy sap in the movie. The cutesy animals took me out of the narrative as much as the kids did. I had friends that cried at their deaths. Why? That's why they're there. Otherwise the HE would just be some arrogant scientist.

The music was even just okay. In the other two movies, the music hit right and drove the scene. In this one, the songs were just there.

Kevin Feige has lost his Midas Touch,kerblamophobe,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159zr6b/kevin_feige_has_lost_his_midas_touch/,1690360096.0,"For the longest time, we've all been witness to how Kevin has steered the MCU into a complex, interweaving story that was absolutely compelling. From humble beginnings of Iron Man to the spectacular epic that was Avengers: Endgame, we let him lead us and he gave us a payoff that made sense and was rewarding to those who stayed the course. 

Of course I know the behind the scenes mess that preceeded all this complete and utter trash of films and Disney plus shows that followed afterwards, but blame still has to reside squarely on the shoulders of the man in charge. Ever since Feige was appointed to CCO of Marvel Enterprises, there has been a sharp down turn in quality seen on the MCU side of things. There was zero focus on where the story was going, no singular vision, no coherent map for where the journey will take us. It felt like every new movie or show was being pulled out of their collective anuses, and I will be the first to admit culpability to eating their crap with a smile on my face. Why? Because I hoped I was going to be rewarded in the end. 

Now, we have show after show, movie after movie that promises big but delivers microscopically. And that has to be the responsibility of the man himself. MR. KEVIN FEIGE, PGA.

He's touted his PGA mark with pride seeing as he was the architect of the Infinity Saga; why not show to the world that he was indeed responsible for everything? So he did. With that Producers Guild mark. But now, it seems as though every single Kevin Feige PGA production has become more and more convoluted and disconnected from the show/movie that comes next.

"Dear Marvel, Please Stop with these Disney+ Shows.",mitchob1012,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a74pe/dear_marvel_please_stop_with_these_disney_shows/,1690381143.0,"*This is a bit of a long one. Sorry 😶
There is a TL:DR at the end if you want to see my main points*

We're now 9(?) shows in and for *every single one* of these shows now, after dedicating 4-6 plus hours of my life keeping up with them, I'm left feeling apathetic at best, and bitterly disappointed at worst. 

I would love to sit in the writing rooms for these shows, because I don't know what goes on in there but it's starting to feel like Feige or someone at the top is mandating a certain formula for these shows that just is not working. 



Let me explain, the average Marvel Disney+ Show;

Episodes 1-2: Good-great set up that plants a lot of seeds that have some excellent potential. There's some interesting thematic work at play, but it really depends on whether the show nails the landing or not. 

Episode 3: Starting to lose a bit of momentum plot wise... The highs are *high*, but the lows are *low*. 

Episode 4: The one where they pull out all the stops or have their big shock ending. All roads lead to a certain point and it's priming us for an epic final few episodes! 

Episode 5: The show has gone completely off the rails and lost all of its momentum from the previous episode. It instead focuses on exposition and/or recapping the events so far. Because they've daudled around for so long this episode, I sure hope the finale is long enough to give all of these dangling threads the time they deserve! 

Episode 6: ""It was alright I guess"" 
Score is overall between a 4-7 out of 10. Despite launching right into the action of the episode they spend most of their time on a big CGI final battle that they don't have the budget for and leave all of the important character and thematic moments for the last 15 minutes of the episode. 
Of those 15 minutes, at least half of that time is spent setting up *future* movies and TV shows instead of actually resolving the conflict(s) at hand in a satisfying way. 
Were left with more questions than answers, and of the answers we have received, most are unsatisfactory or could have been done so much better. 




I've seen and felt these type of thoughts for most if not *all* of these shows. 

Getting real for a second, I know there are the strikes going on currently and that no work is really being done on any upcoming projects other than Post as it is anyways. 

But once this is all resolved (with a satisfying result for the Unions) I really hope Feige and Marvel and Disney really look at fan reception, or at the very least, the numbers. 

We know that Bob Iger is cleaning house at the moment (for better or worse) and cutting back on spending for projects. 
We know that Secret Invasion among (presumably) other projects have been getting significantly lower ratings than previous shows. 
We know that they can do better. 

I honestly think ever since we got these Disney+ shows, the MCU has been all the worse for them. 
They fell right into the criticism that so many people levelled at the franchise *before* Endgame in that there was already too many movies to keep track of. 

*NOW* there are too many movies and entire *seasons* of television to keep up with! 


Let's take The Marvel's for example; 
As of now there are at least 3 Disney+ shows that people should have familiarised themselves with in order to understand the movie (and that's not even counting movies).

We have, WandaVision (Monica). 
Ms. Marvel (duh) 
And now Secret Invasion. 

3 shows, all with mixed at best reception (minus maybe WandaVision depending on who you ask). 


*TL;DR*
Marvel has become a cultural landmark, but in doing so has alienated the general audiences that grew it so large in the first place, and is turning away even some of their biggest fans. 

I believe that Disney/Marvel *desperately* need to reconsider their current business and writing model for these smaller projects. 

Despite what they have stated, I honestly think they should focus on the Special Presentations as opposed to the shows. 

I have zero clue what the money situation with the two we got were and how successful they were for the company, but Werewolf by Night and the Guardians Holiday Special and by far the best original Disney+ content by a landslide, and it's no coincidence that they're both easily digestible, 45-1hr long specials. 

I honestly think if we had a Ms. Marvel Special Presentation to lead into the upcoming movie (same with maybe She Hulk and Moon Knight?) fans like myself won't feel so burnt out on the MCU. 

Give us a quick and easy slice of these characters that satisfy us now but also leave us wanting just that *bit* more. 

I don't want a 6 hour show about Agatha, or Echo, or Ironheart. 

But Special Presentations? Hell yes."

"The people who ""left"" the MCU after Endgame weren't even huge Marvel fans to begin with.",Inevitable_Golf_1816,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a9mk6/the_people_who_left_the_mcu_after_endgame_werent/,1690387004.0,"This does not apply to everyone, but it does to A LOT of people.  

Imma be real, a LOT of people who left after Endgame were casual viewers who only arrived for the Infinity War/Endgame hype. I bet these people were ""fans"" for a very limited time.

I had friends, and those friends had friends who watched very little Marvel, but suddenly cared about everything that came before and were watching MCU films on their laptops when Thanos was around the corner. It was even a running joke between myself and someone I knew. My aunt does not watch Marvel, but saw Endgame because her friends wanted her to.

DS2 and NWH were anomalies because of their potential crossover elements. DS2 had Wanda, Professor X, Mr Fantastic, Peggy Carter, etc., while NWH had Dr Strange, as well the Raimi/Webb characters that were from outside THIS franchise. Black Panther 2 and Guardians 3 managed to be a massive success on their own merits, with no crossovers or fan service required.

I'm just sayin…..

Also, here’s my own hot take. The MCU doesn't HAVE to be the #1 franchise anymore. That doesn’t mean they should get worse. I want them to improve, but if they were to not end up at the top of the world anymore, then so be it. If I still have fun with it, then I’ll be OK. If this happens, that doesn’t mean it’s a dead franchise. "

But watching Dr strange 2 in the beginning I wondered if that was case they why did strange continue to say that was his only play so it got me thinking.

The man asked strange did half the population have to die not was it the only way thanos could have been defeated. And strange replies yes it was our plan. So I thought well why Dr strange could have used the stone on thanos or could have put him in a time loop why didn't he use a portal to go back to earth why did thanos have to kill half the population what would happen if he didn't.

Then I remembered in eternals they said how because thanos did that he prevented the celestial birth. And we know the mcu loves connecting movies so its not coincidence in the mcu timeline order this move comes right after eternals. Maybe strange new this would happen and new if the tiamut would have came 5 years earlier maybe the eternals would have let it be born causing the earth to be destroyed.

And yea that's just my theory sorry that this is long I like typing my thoughts out and also mb if this theory was already established but I didn't know I just thought of it myself rn."
Less characters/storylines and more connected universe/crossovers or more characters/storylines and less connected universe/crossovers?,Puedo60,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159cw8d/less_charactersstorylines_and_more_connected/,1690301501.0,"So I hear that Bob Chapek pretty much forced Marvels hand to expand and over saturate their story telling in phases 4-6 

If we can get a redo. Would you prefer marvel to continue wrapping up any loose threads that were around at the end of phase 3 before introducing new ""solo"" movie/show characters? New characters can still be introduced but in other people's movies like DS2. (So more focus on legacy characters needing a sequel)

Or are you content with Marvel trying to expand the universe even though it means we wont see certain characters reoccurring as often or as much?

To me Phases 4-5 are like ""what if we treated these marvel movies/stories independently, without as many sequels planned right away, but they live in a shared universe. We're also not going to crossover as much because we want these characters to have their own storyline/movie"" 

I think the general audience would rather have less characters and less storylines happening at the same. That way it's easier to follow and ""would feel more connected"""

Also, no Season2 of SI was announced to be envisioned yet by the production, and they would probably want to wait for the reactions of fans to the first season when it is finished (I still hope for a truly surprising grand finale with some mindblowing revelations and not just a fight between Super Skrulls) and after all those who wait for all the episodes to be available before they binge them all at once were able to watch it.

But IF there could be a sequel, what story could it tell, based on the comics source or not?

I think an adaptation of the Secret Empire major crossover event would work great. With a Skrull Nation instead of a Hydra Nation. 

For it to work, Chris Evans would have to agree to reprise his roe as Steven Rogers / Captain America of course..

 

 
Here is my personal pitch (which is a remix of various totally revised elements from several comics many will recognize) =

 
Old Rogers (the one we see at the end of Endgame) could be hired as an adviser (maybe NSA) by new president Thunderbolt Ross and of course he will be killed by a mysterious sniper (a brainwashed Sharon Carter) and revealed as a Skrull upon dying.

Some footage would appear among the Intelligence and superhuman community apparently showing that the Captain America we’ve seen from the beginning in modern time has always been a Skrull impostor working for Fury, so the Avengers always had a Skrull among them since their creation.
A video would show the actual “rescue” attempt of Captain America from the plane crash at the bottom of the Ocean would have retrieved a frozen Rogers irremediably dead, but with part of his brain preserved by the ice. Fury would have had the idea to have a Skrull impersonate him, and absorb his memories from he still barely alive brain. And maybe use Arnim Zola and Fernhoff (Dr Faustus), since both were revealed to be under US custody in the Agent Carter series, to possibly enhance Skrull Cap physically and brainwash him so he believes himself to be the real original CA until Fury deemed it was time to reveal him as a Skrull.. People would start doubting Captain America’s “True Colors” during all these years, even some great fans of his could start to believe that although he did indeed bravely lead the fights to save Earth many times, his secret ultimate goal was always to have the Skrulls control Earth by impersonating all his political and economical leaders..  

President Ross would immediately seize that opportunity to justify his anti-superhuman politics (advocating for a reinstatement of the Sokovia Accords?), claiming none of them could be trusted and that they should all remain under permanent tight control by the US military

Heroes would be divided about what to believe about Captain America’s real recent history.  Of course Sam and Bucky would be the most affected by these revelations.

Sure enough, at the end, everything would be revealed as having been a gigantic hoax, conceived by a very angry young Skrull girl called Kobik (implied to be the daughter of Gravik), a computer genius able to manipulate the social medias and create incredibly realistic fake news (including using Mysterio’s holograph technology), going online under the hacker codename of “Shaper of Worlds”..

I thought part of this could fit nicely in CA4 Brave New World (previously NWO), but they are apparently definitely going another way with that one…

 
After Secret Invasion and Secret Empire, maybe season 3 could be Secret Avengers or Secret Wariors?

minor theory idea for president Ritson ( spoilers for SI ep5),Quiet_Effective7234,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/158qo6t/minor_theory_idea_for_president_ritson_spoilers/,1690240983.0,"At the end of  episode 4 we see Fury takes a shocked ( but not really visibly wounded?) President Ritson in his car and take him away from the battlescene.

At the beginning of the following episode we discover he apparently took him to a local hospital for examination ( and minor surgery?), where he stands guard in front of the door, Skrhodey and his secret service goons later finallybarrive and take over the place.
After a tense discussion with Fury, the fake Rhodey forces the latter to run away (now wanted for the murder of Maria Hill), so he can convince the president to NUKE New Skrullos in Russia as per Gravik's directives.

There will have to be a follow up to that in the final episode, although it will probably be a short one..


My theory is that Fury did NOT immediately take Ritson to that hospital.. ( we did not see him drive there).

He may have taken him first to a safe house of friendly Skrulls faithful to Talos and Fury himself. 

Surely these Skrulls would have the medical technology to cure Ritson, and would also be able to better hide and protect the president under attack. 

Fury would then have taken with him a Skrull agent impersonating Ritson to proceed to the hospital, as he for sure would have anticipated the arrival of hostile Skrhodey soon after, and his being expelled from the president's entourage..

That would be a great way to trick Skhrodey and figure out his scheme.

The fake president ( Skritson?) could later expose both himself/herself and Rhodey as alien shapeshifters,  making the US army realize they were manipulated and stopping the nuclear strike which would have brought WW3. And have his Skrulls allies bring Ritson safe and well, proving there are many Skrulls opposed to conflict and wanting to live peacefully with humans.

Of course, Ritson would lose a lot of credibility and would probably be forced to resign, making way for General Thunderbolt Ross to become the new president with a  Brave New World political platform campaign, advocating a harder stance on superheroes and on Skrulls..



I would like to see the fake Ritson be revealed as an alive Soren, and then have her permanently take the human shape of Maria Hill ( welcome back M&amp;s Smulders)"

Netflix Marvel shows are notorious for working comic characters in the show, even if it’s just copying a name. So I’ve been wondering who Lewis Wilson is in the comics (he’s the veteran suffering from severe PTSD). It’s Force! Force, in the comics, is Clay Wilson. And what’s Lewis’s father’s name in the show? Clay. This isn’t the first time Marvel has replaced a comic character with a son. In Iron Man 2, Ivan Vanko is Whiplash, while it’s his father, Anton Vanko, who is the actual Whiplash in the comics. I just felt like sharing this revelation, it took me 2 times watching the series to figure it out, and I’ve seen many threads about how the character is totally new and separate from the comics. Why did they rewrite the character and make the son the villain instead of Clay? I’m not sure, but sneaking his father’s role into the show so subtlety was a cool move imo. The powers don’t match, we don’t see any similarities in costume, but it’s not a coincidence that we have a villain who has ties to a character with Force’s name. I think the goal was to create a new character with some kind of loose ties to an actual marvel villain. It’s little Easter eggs like this that I think make these shows so fun to watch and unpack.

What Thor should have done in The Dark World:,Shadowkiva,6,https://i.redd.it/1c5kwbq5cydb1.jpg,1690221449.0,"Imo it would have been a MUCH better movie if Thor had killed Malekith (maybe even imprison him somehow but permadeath is fine too) then worked out a way to revitalise the Dark Elves so they can live in a new terraformed homeworld using the Aether. What he ended up doing was helping Malekith genocide his own people and while it's made clear that Malekith was a bad dude for being ok with that all-or-nothing approach it's also made somewhat clear that Odin was fine with it as well. 

Thor building off his climactic showdown with Loki in the first film should NOT be ok with that at all. Malekith wanted to rule the universe again in darkness... I'm sure out of all the other black hole grenaders at least some of them just wanted the darkness so they could chill privately and survive in peace. The surviving Svartafljàr could even later become either casualties or allies against Thanos out of cooperation with Odinson forming a new dynamic between the Aesir and the Svartalfjar survivors (especially after Ragnarok they understand each other more).

Cherry on top would be a Svartafljar rallying miniplot for Endgame Thor instead of the grimey Fortnite dobber who checked out of life and let his new alcoholic friend Valkyrie enable his own spiral into alcoholism. Come on... where's the God of Thunder from the comics? Where's the Thor that grows to be a better, wiser and kinder King than even Odin while still being fiercely capable as a warrior? Do that! Not every hero has to be supremely relatable in the most trivial ways.

* Deadpool is bringing back Hugh Jackman's **Wolverine** and there are rumours of &gt;!more Fox characters from the X-Men series and the Fantastic Four series, along with Elektra and potentially Affleck as Daredevil!&lt;

Now all that is left is these actors/characters:

* Nic Cage Ghost Rider
* Eric Bana Hulk
* Terrence Howard War Machine
* Thomas Jane Punisher
* The people from Sony's universe: Kraven, Morbius, whoever is in Madame Web
* The Spider-Verse Gang
* Topher Grace Venom, Harry Osborne from a different Raimi Universe
* New Goblin, Gwen Stacy Spider-Woman and Rhino from Webb Universe
* New Mutants cast
* The remaining X-Men 2000-2006 cast
* X-Men First Class - Dark Phoenix actors
* Fantastic Four actors from 2005 and 2015
* Agent Coulson, Quake and the cast of AoS  
Cloak, Dagger and The Runaways from the shows (Very unilkely though)
* Last but not the least, Wesley Snipes Blade

Ideally all these actors could show up in Secret Wars in some capacity. Would be cool. What do you guys think?

The MCU should have had more stuff set in the blip,Praetorian92,2064,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1578rs3/the_mcu_should_have_had_more_stuff_set_in_the_blip/,1690099414.0,"Title, essentially. All the shows and movies that have come out have all been set post-Endgame. For some of these - WandaVision, FATWS, etc - the timeline is important but movies like Shang-Chi, or shows like Moon Knight could have been set in that long 5 years. 
It just feels like that was a great window to have new heroes step up so that post-Endgame they'd already be experienced.

Thought of this during secret invasion because it would have also been really cool if Fury didn't get snapped away but instead had this taking up his time. That path could have allowed for the creation of the Secret Warriors."

As we look forward to 2024, Marvel Studios was planning on releasing 3 movies and 5 shows that year but with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA Strike, it will change.

In 2024, Marvel Studios was supposed to release their content including:

*Captain America: Brave New World*
*Thunderbolts*
*Ironheart*
*Agatha: Coven of Chaos*
*Deadpool 3*
*Daredevil: Born Again*

Which 3 movies and 1 show stopped production until the strike ends. *Brave New World* wrapped filming on June 30, 2023, but it still needs reshoots, *Deadpool 3* was halfway through the filming process, *Born Again* halted production and *Thunderbolts* filming date was delayed. Since those four ended their Productions due to the Ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA Strike, this will not end well.

Brave New World could end up releasing in 2025, Thunderbolts might release in November 2024, Deadpool 3 might be delayed to 2026 and Daredevil: Born Again could end up releasing in August 2024, meaning their 2024 slate will change. Ironheart and Agatha: Coven of Chaos are expected to come out this year, hopefully, if not they might get delayed to 2026 or 2027 respectively. X-Men '97 might come out still in 2024. 

I know, I know, how could I forget ""Spider-Man: Freshman Year"", the animated Spider-Man series coming to Disney+ that's releasing in 2024, well. I want this show to be canceled because we don't need it.

But 2024 could end up effecting Marvel Studios content that's releasing next year

- No big CGI monster battle
- Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh return (alongside Simu Liu obviously)
- Donnie Yen, Ke Huy Quan or Stephanie Hzu join the cast _(although Ke has already been cast in Loki season 2 … Donnie Yen would make a great Lei Kung The Thunderer)_
- A post credit scene where Spider-man seeks out Shang Chi for “karate lessons”

That would explain why their relation is so personal and complicated, including Gravik's not being willing to kill his father figure himself ( something he could easily have done in episode 1 already), and on the other hand Fury's not wanting to involve other parties to resolve this himself because it is his fault.

Fury would have seen Gravik getting more radical over the years, and maybe plan early for a contingency in case Gravik really crossed the line.

Gravik would have seen his adoptive father founding of the Mighty Avengers, and felt betrayed by him not wanting to create a team of Super Skrulls warriors to fight the War against the Krees and ""avenge"" the massacre of his real biological parents.. Hence his obsession with getting the Harvest ( which may be revealed of having been a bait imagined by Fury against Gravik's power-angry mad schemes, reinforced by Fury sending Gravik himself retrieve some of that Avengers DNA)..."

If he shrinks by a small percentage shedding mass equivalent to one front adult-size tooth that will yield an explosive energy equivalent to one Hiroshima because that mass has to be coverted into something. Don't give me the ""his mass remains the same"" nonsense because it clearly doesn't when he's running around on top of guns and standing on people's shoulders without burrowing into their flesh from the needle-like pressure. He also punched that Leviathan in Endgame which if the mass was the same would have bounced him back several kilometers like a giant parade balloon, while the Leviathan felts nothing but a gentle tap.


Secondly is that (oh man this will make me sad again) Murphy's portrayal made me wish that T'Challa was still in the MCU as this portrayal of a charismatic, loner to the point of seeming somewhat arrogant (but really just good at leadership and making plans and strategies to get things done), science genius who studied from the best professors in the world is EXACTLY the T'Challa from the comics. Moreso with how, in the aftermath of his actions to prevent the ""bad guys"" with their ""bad ideologies"" from taking over the world and everything he holds dear, he still wrestles with the moral and ethical implications of what his scientific mind and his ability to mobilize people has wrought onto the world that didn't have that power or technology yet to even stand a chance.  &gt;! I also really liked how Oppenheimer had to balance keeping everyone working in the desert smoothly and making sure they all stayed where they were and kept everything a secret ... that could work with the Wakanda-isolationism. Oppie was even slyly stabbed in the back by a man he trusted who ended up being a mole for the USSR adding a geopolitical element to the personal stakes again.. fitting for Black Panther !&lt;

 He (in the comics) invented a new branch of physics around the unique properties of vibranium and quantum states, he was the first to witness an Incursion starting to happen by peering into its threshold and raising the alarm to the Illuminati, sent a mission to explore a distant planet then got displaced forward in time and still made his way back to present time, beat back the Skrull Secret Invasion along with a planet-consuming horde of symbiotes.

Why would the Skrulls want to take on a world that they can never win? Even if they nuked the whole world, the Hulk alone would destroy anything they built from the ashes. 

And on a side not, every single advanced civilization in the MCU should be looking at Earth as the scariest planet in existence. As far as they know, everywhere a human goes empire’s fall. The Kree sent an armada to Earth and only one ship returned. Thanos destroyed world after world, until he went to Earth. Not once, but three times his armies were destroyed, although the second time he did manage to escape, but on the third he finally fell. One green human goes to Asgard, next thing they hear Asgard exploded and the survivors are kept in a zoo on Earth. Celestials, can’t stop them right? Wrong! Two celestials dead.

What would have happened if MCU was real life? The remaining Avengers and Fury/Talos would completely vouch for Spiderman and the public opinion would instantly be in Spiderman's favor. Daily bugle works in a world where Avengers don't exist and aren't public heros.

We see the same thing in Secret Invasion. It js revealed on TV that shapeshifting aliens are in Russia. And shortly after it is shown that Fury is killing Maria Hill. Anybody with half a brain would know its an imposter rather than the guy who formed the Avengers and saved the world many times. Fury could also easily expose that Rhodey is a skrull. 


These situations to build tension need a lot of suspension of disbelief.

Also, I read a bunch of comments and a lot of people are talking about the vocal minority of conspiracy theorists.

It is not about space between projects. They dont have that stuff going out. TV shows used to put out weekly episodes throught out the year and people enjoy that and dont feel its too much.

The reason, is not the amount of projects, but the amount of parallel storylines. 

If the project were connected enough and leading to common points more quickly, there will not be any ""burn out feeling"". But now MCU is kind of generating a lot of mental load without payoff to fans. Except Wandavision and Loki, shows opened a lot of storylines and are still waiting to be continued. If we take phase 4 movies and series, it generated so much stuff, out the top of my head from Blackwidows running on the loose everywhere, to a Celestial threatning to destroy earth, with the power broker in place, many organisations including the ten rings, spidermans identity forgotten, multiverse shenanigans, bunch of new hulks...

And each project, does not resolve what is already outthere and does not build on it. Each new project, just adds new unrelated stuff. People were used to having some links, some caracters, or some stories come back every 2 to 3 projects. Not have more than 10 projects all just adding new stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not about the rythm of the project, but how they are designed. If the amount of tv shows and movies was the same, with the exact same schedule we got, but with more common stories, the feelings would have been much better.

Portions of this fan base has become very insufferable over the last couple years.

More on that in minute. I think the interactions between Rhodey and Fury, Fury and Talos, Talos and Gravik, and Fury and Sonya Falsworth, and whoever Falsworth is threatening this week with her charm and a weapon, have been great some of the MCU’s best. I think Falsworth has been a tremendous addition to the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Olivia Coleman, and Don Cheadle have been a joy to watch. Some great acting here and I feel the writing has been solid enough. 

Therefore, I can’t help but be surprised and not surprised that others have been so critical. I’m suprised that more haven’t liked the show but not surprised because in the sense of the last couple years, MCU fans have become increasingly hard to please.


I feel that if Secret Invasion was launched in phase 3 or between infinity war and endgame, people would be praising the show’s darker storyline and talking about how great the show is. Instead people are nitpicking this and that and it just seems MCU fans are hard to please anymore, and it makes really hard to want engage with other MCU fans nowadays. Infinity War and Endgame created this insane and unrealistic standard, and the MCU was never going to be able to hit that level of standard every time post- Endgame, and when it doesn’t hit people’s unrealistic standard, then the movie or show is torn apart and criticized and to me that is just toxic. The MCU never even hit that standard pre- Infinity War. It was just popular (and despite some claims to the contrary, it still is… box office results are on par with phase 3 results). Just my two cents after observing for the last few years. 

TL/DR: If Secret Invasion released before Endgame, people would be praising the show. Now people have unrealistic standards and they’re criticizing the show because it can’t hit those standards, and to me that is insufferable and portions of the community have become very insufferable over the last few years. 

And yes, I’m prepared for the downvotes."

But the general audience would’ve seen or know of a lot of origins by this stage, if they wanted to be bold they could throw us into an already semi established universe pretty easily. Good opportunity to fix the mistakes they’ve made as well like dr strange. 

You can skip the big origin and open with say, a Dr strange becomes sorcerer supreme in a Triumph and Torment movie. There, dr strange in the status quo he’s mainly known and liked for in one movie whereas in the mcu it’s been 7 years and he’s still not there yet. 

Could even pull a James Gunn and cherry pick what to keep, you want mature Spider-Man played by Tom Holland still? Why not?"

Hot Take = TALOS is still alive.. ( spoilers for SI ep5),Quiet_Effective7234,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1584qr2/hot_take_talos_is_still_alive_spoilers_for_si_ep5/,1690188083.0,"OK, obviously this will not be a popular theory.

But we never saw Talos actually die on screen, did we?

He was last seen abandoned by Fury bleeding profusely and APPARENTLY  dying at the end of episode 4

In his Skrull form, sure, but he actually started morphing earlier when he was shot trying to get the president out of the car. And In episode 5 we very conveniently witness a scene where the Van Gogh Skrull turns into his true Skrull shape when Sonya shoots him in the leg. Basically proving to us seeing a Skrull morphing back does not mean he is dead or even really dying..

I  anticipate the immediate counter-argument that in episode 5 we also see a very emotional ( and well written) scene showing the funeral ceremony of Talos body by G'iah and Varra/Priscilla..

But was that really Talos' body? 
Remember it is Fury who sends G'iah to his wife to deal with her grief..

Most importantly, what are honestly the odds Varra ( working alone) could have retrieved the dead body of Talos just a few hours after his alleged death? Wouldn't you think the US military would have kept that body of an alien shapeshifter involved in an attack against the president under the tightest security for study and eventual scientific experiments/ analysis? And Varra would have been able to steal it and just bring it back very fast to her manor? I have a hard time accepting that..

And if you think G'iah would surely have recognized her father's body and  not have been fooled by a decoy, remember another very convenient piece of information casually dropped by Fury in a conversation with Sonya in episode 5 again. He mentions he has access to a newer version of the ""Widow's Veil"" illusion technology that is able to disguise the whole ""BODY""..

It certainly would be very cruel of Fury to manipulate Giah's feeling that way and have her go through that traditional ritual mockery. But it sure would be totally in character with the devious schemer Old Nick always was, manipulating his own troops with lies to motivate them for the coming fight..

Remember Avengers 1 and the death of a man called Coulson?





Which brings another question : what happened to the real Talos and where is he now?

He could still be in the hands of the US military.
Maybe he lost his shapeshifting powers ( he never had any in the comics) due to the heavy injuries he sustained, and they had to turn him into a alien cyborg (his look in the comics).
Maybe we will see him return to help the real Rhodey fight Raava / Skrhodey in Armor Wars?
Who knows?

Or did Talos bring in 500k during the Blip and the other 500k after Fury fucked off to SABER?

On a related note, how did he do it? Even during the Blip, landing enough spaceships on Earth to relocate a million individuals would have to have raised *some* attention."

It would honestly help the mcu in many aspects like the examples below
*it could fully remove lots of the extra fluff or heroes that aren’t very important to the over all narrative 
*it could recast a lot of characters who’s actors unfortunately passed away without it feeling disrespectful or replacing the characters (black panther, thunderbolt Ross)
*it would take lots of characters who had Disney plus original shows and revamp their origins for a movie while keeping the actors to simplify them 
*would retire a lot of actors and actresses without having to kill them  
*reboot the hulk so that he gets the movies he deserves and finally have him fight thunderbolt 
*would bring in the mutants for their own saga (I feel it’s too late for them to introduce the men properly in one phase

Also many more. It would keep some all the heroes who still have good stories to tell like Spider-Man the guardians and Shang chi and who ever else

Imagine your not-so-religious neighbour being dusted, while you, a true believer, are left behind in the world of sinners.

I'm not sure how quickly did the facts about the Battle of Wakanda spread (I figure, rather instantly, but the facts don't always stop believers from believing), but in the early days there must have been some confusion, and various preachers could take it as 'the-end-is-here' scenario and mass suicides could take place."

Marvel Movies give their Audience Unrealistic Body and Beauty Expectations,Concerned_Movie_Fan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/157hq3p/marvel_movies_give_their_audience_unrealistic/,1690126144.0,"Hello everyone,

I'm an undergrad student in America, and like everyone else here I am a fan of Marvel movies. I'm posting in this sub today to talk about a dark side tour favorite movies (one of many to be honest). I'm talking about how Marvel, and others, show unrealistic depictions of male and female bodies, and how it can have adverse consequences for the young audience these films garner.

Its an unspoken fact in Hollywood that action film actors, especially male actors, use supplements and other ""enhancements"" to give them the superhero body they need to film. While I'm not trying to shame them, there is substantial evidence that young and longtime audience members try to emulate their film idols, and in doing so will oftentimes either start to hate their own bodies or resort to supplements like steroids to achieve their unrealistic asperations. If more actors and film studios were open and honest with this fact I think the audience would have more realistic expectations on what level of fitness they can achieve if they try. There is also the fact that the female actors in Marvel films are pretty much all supermodels, with perfect hair and make up all while fighting to save the world. Once again, not trying to shame but this can also give younger audience members unrealistic beauty standards. I think Marvel has come a long way in trying to not objectify it's female actors, and I think they do a good job overall, but this is still a glaring issue. "

Will they be finally accepted ( even if reluctantly by most humans) and allowed to live on Earth? In their own skin? Maybe in their own isolated Skrull Island country ( a Green and Pleasant Land)?


Or will we remain with a Status Quo of sorts with all these Skrulls keeping living in hiding on Earth, but with their existence now known to the world, creating a global paranoia and a witch-hunt in most countries.
? A premise for a possible season 2 with more paranoia than the first? A version of Dark Reign involving the Skrulls instead of unregistered superhumans? Enter the Thunderbolts?  Skrull Kill Krew?


As a side note, ""one million"" Skrulls is a number that seems big and it surely has shock value, but truly in terms of population it is definitely not that much.. over a hundred cities on Earth have way over a million inhabitants, with Tokyo having over 37 millions.

That, or (I suppose), Huginn and Muninn would have to be observing any Asgardians on missions, or a talented sorcerer would have to send an illusion to check up on you regularly.

I would like to say a few things before I continue. For one, yes I am aware that the finale is nothing different from the comics as she would rip pages and skip through panels. Second, I am only talking about the finale here, any 4th wall break previously was clever and subtle which was great. Now let’s begin.





The She-Hulk finale just really over saturates the whole 4th wall breaking concept. 4th wall breaking is always meant to be subtle and clever since it’s a jab at viewers, the network, cliches, etc… Deadpool movies are a perfect example of how you do 4th wall breaking, you have Wade make a few quips, maybe a joke like him turning the camera or putting gum on it by accident, that is literally it. The DP films never made it to where 4th wall breaking is incorporated into the plot. 




She-Hulk going into the studios and forcing Feige to change the plot felt extremely excessive. Maybe they could’ve had a different approach. Even then though, the ending to She-Hulk is essentially that she can now change anything to whatever she wants? No life lessons no character development? I mean the bad guy gets arrested and Matt comes back but it felt underwhelming like we weren’t awarded that. It would’ve been awesome to see Matt come back on his own since it would’ve showed that he does care, not because Feige made him come back.





This also just creates a huge plot inconvenience like with Harry Potter and the time turners cause now every fan is just gonna bring up “Why can’t She-Hulk just see Feige again and stop Kang from killing everyone” and blah blah blah. Now everyone is just gonna bring that up when something in regards to She-Hulk doesn’t make sense."

I know how shared of an opinion this is, but I just needed to say it! I haven’t been able to stop thinking about Vol. 3 since I saw it in theaters. It’ll just pop back into my mind, and along with it the other two volumes, which I love just as much, if not more (My favorite of the 3 changes on a daily basis.). From the characters (Who I’ve been in love with since the first trailer I saw for Vol. 1, and my favorite character being Peter Quill.), to the worlds, to the stories (Every Guardians movie’s story has been immaculate, not to mention the antagonists, Ego being a standout and my favorite Marvel movie villain.), and the humor (So, so many quotable lines, with my favorite being: “You’re making me beat up grass!”), these movies feel like they were made for me. For a little context, the first movie I remember seeing in theaters was GotG Vol. 1 (I can still remember the heartbreak I felt while watching Groot die.), and GotG Vol. 3 was the first movie to ever make me cry (The tears were welled up in my eyes throughout the entire movie, it got especially hard to contain them when Rocket screamed, but I just couldn’t keep ‘em in after Rocket started playing “Come And Get Your Love”.), so I definitely have a bit of a bias, but putting every one of my biases aside I still feel like this trilogy is perfect. So many scenes in these films give me chills every time I watch them, with some standouts being the Guardians sharing the power stone, come a little bit closer, Ego telling Peter what he did to his mother, and the hallway scene. And the last thing I’d like to mention here is just how beautiful of an ending the Guardians got in Vol. 3. None of the Guardians family died, and their bonds with each other only got stronger. In a way, Vol. 3 was the end of an era for me personally. I’ve grown up with these characters, and it’s hard to see them go, but I’m not going to cry because it’s over, I’m going to smile because it happened. These movies will be movies that I continue to revisit for the rest of my life, and I’ll enjoy every second of them.

TL;DR - The GotG movies are my favorite movies of all time, and I just wanted to express my love for them! What do you think of the GotG movies?"

Here, I would like to present another theory, one that a few other fans have suggested before.

Towards the end of the first season of Loki, we were introduced to the [Void,](https://thedirect.s3.amazonaws.com/media/photos/loki-avengers-tower-scene.jpg) a pocket realm situated at the end of time. It is home to various timelines/universes (like the abandoned cities and the Stark Tower) and variants (like Alligator Loki, Old Loki, etc) that were pruned by the TVA. When they are sent to the Void, Alioth consumes them. Basically, think of the Void as a dump for pruned realities and Alioth as a living furnace that cleans it out to make way for more garbage.

With all this information in mind, I think there’s a good chance the Void will serve as the MCU's version of Battleworld. Being how Ailoth was seemingly killed or incapacitated by Loki and Sylvie, any universe that the TVA prunes in the future will remain in the Void. Overtime, these universes may accumulate and form a colorful patchwork realm like Battleworld. If there is no Alioth to consume any variants, the Void may also fill up with various civilizations that are similar to Zsaji’s people from the original 1985 Secret Wars storyline.

If this happens, I think Kang will end up using the Void as the location for his own secret war. At the end of The Kang Dynasty, he will use the TVA’s pruning technology to stop incursions caused by his variants and send any remaining universes to the Void. There, he will force hundreds of Multiversal heroes and villains to fight to decide who will get to live in his version of the Sacred Timeline."
First Footage of Disney+ X-Men Reboot Released at Comic-Con,FictionFantom,2242,https://thedirect.com/article/x-men-reboot-disney-plus-footage,1689902737.0,
just a little SORENess... ( spoilers for SI ep1 to 5),Quiet_Effective7234,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/156egbd/just_a_little_soreness_spoilers_for_si_ep1_to_5/,1690014692.0,"We were told at the beginning of the series that Talos’ wife and partner Soren was dead (supposedly due to Gravik), but were actually never shown her dying.. 

So for all effects, according to comics and tv shows rules, she is of course most probably not dead at all, and hiding behind the scenes or probably even in plain sight.

 
If so, what character seen in the show could she be revealed as having impersonated ?

 

Maria Hill?
My favorite theory for that one. That they were actually TWO different Hills in episode 1, the “Right Hill” (the original Maria we see in the opening scenes and who dies at the end), and the “Left (Behind) Hill” (Soren impersonating Maria like she did in the post credit scene of FAFH, appearing in the bar scene with Fury, and maybe having some of the Right Hill memories the latter would have willingly given her).
That would allow us to see Cobie Smulders return as the fake (Black?) “Maria” assisting or replacing Fury as the director of SHIELD on Earth

 

Nick Fury ?
I think that a Green Fury would have been an interesting idea. 
Especially considering Talos words ”she loved you” to the latter when they are first reunited at the beginning of episode 1. 
Imagine something happened to Fury on SABER (after the post credit scene of Spiderman FAFH, obviously), and the Skrulls being despaired all their plans to have him use his power on Earth (which they actively helped him gain) to find a Home for them there. 
And then Soren volunteers to take the shape of their dear friend and fully absorb his memories to keep their project going on. But something goes wrong, the absorption is too complete and Fury’s willpower too strong, so his mind totally and definitively overrides that of Soren, so that she truly believes she is the real Fury and forgets she is a Skrull.. It would give a total new meaning to Fury being repeatedly told “he is not the MAN he used to be” by Skrulls in episode 1.
Maybe later on “Fury” (Nick’s mind in Soren’s body) can finally access her shapeshifting powers (so he becomes “the Unseen”) and Skrull longevity (an equivalent of the Infinity Formula he has in the comics).. 

 

Talos?
If Talos is either dead or on a far away secret mission in outer space (maybe discussing with emperor Drogge), Soren might have taken his place and shape on Earth in the interim, so that it is really her we have been seeing the whole time in Secret Invasion from episode 1… Too complicated and totally unnecessary at this late stage..

 

 

President Ritson?
It would have been interesting to have Soren impersonate US president Ritson without Skrhodey being aware of it. But here again, there is probably no point for such a late meaningless revelation in the last episode.. And where would the real president be?

 

 

Sonya Falsworth? 
It would definitely not correspond to the character and personality previously shown by Soren.

X-Men rumor from August 2022,HandBanana666,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155wj92/xmen_rumor_from_august_2022/,1689965314.0,"There was recently another 4Chan plot ""leak"" about the upcoming *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* movie. This latest on claims that the original X-Men cast will be in the MCU by the end of the movie. Now I don't believe the overall ""plot leak"" because production hasn't finished yet, the source is from 4Chan, and there's little-to-no mention of the confirmed characters/actors (such as Emma Corrin who is suppose to be the main villain).

However, that ""leak"" did reminded me of a report from last year. On ***August 24th 2022***, the YouTuber Warren Thompson (aka *The Cosmic Wonder*) said that he heard a rumor about *Deadpool 3*. That some of the original X-Men were going to be in it and were coming to the MCU with Deadpool, and that some of them weren't going to be recast. He said it in this video at 3:00:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN\_vngrxjR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_vngrxjR0)

Then a month later on ***September 27th 2022***, Hugh Jackman announced that he was going to return as Wolverine for Deadpool 3 (or *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* as it might possibly be titled). Then Patrick Stewart suggested that he and Ian McKellen are returning to their X-Men roles. So the rumor is probably true since original X-Men members were later confirmed to be returning.

But is that just coincidence? I think not! On top of that, Hugh Jackman himself stated that he made the decision to return at ***the end of August 2022***, which is the same exact time Warren Thompson reported on the rumor. So it is very unlikely to be coincidence. Sources:

&gt;He really meant it when he said he was retiring as Wolverine. But then in 2016, “I went to a screening of ‘Deadpool.’ I was 20 minutes in, and I was like, ‘Ah, damn it!’ All I kept seeing in my head was ‘48 Hours’ with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. So it’s been brewing for a long time. It just took me longer to get here.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**At the end of August**, during a road trip to the beach with his family, he finally made the decision. He called Reynolds, who’d been pleading “on the daily” for a Wolverine-Deadpool movie. “I think, actually, he’d given up,” Jackman says. “I think it was a big shock to him. There was a massive pause, and then he said, ‘I can’t believe the timing of this.’”

[https://variety.com/2022/film/features/hugh-jackman-dad-death-the-son-wolverine-1235413831/](https://variety.com/2022/film/features/hugh-jackman-dad-death-the-son-wolverine-1235413831/)

***August 14th 2022***, to be exact. A week before the video was posted.

&gt;“None of us wanted to screw with that,” Jackman said about messing with “Logan,” its events, or its somber, definitive conclusion. “I was really proud of that movie and what we did, and it felt like perfect. And actually, for five years, honestly, in my heart, I was done. **I was like, ‘This is it.’ And then it was August, August 14 \[2022\], I was driving and \[boom,\] it came to me like that.** I thought, ‘This could be so much fun; I’ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I’ve ever done.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And Jackman emphasized how much of a change of heart it was for him. “And on August 13, I was like, ‘I’m never playing that part again,’ I promise you,” he said.

Warren Thompson has also reported on some legit rumors in the past. Like Professor X appearing in *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* back in early 2020. He said this weeks before Patrick Stewart revealed that he had conversations with Kevin Feige about returning as Professor X.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTtq0WO9Z8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTtq0WO9Z8)

Kevin Feige himself has also said that they don't want to recast certain Spider-Man roles like Doc Ock and Norman Osborn because the original actors were too good in those roles. That's probably also the reason why they brought JK Simmons back as J. Johan Jameson instead of recasting the role. So it is possible that this also applies to certain X-Men roles.

Stop Asking Why Fury Doesn't Call The Avengers!,AncientAssociation9,708,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15533ga/stop_asking_why_fury_doesnt_call_the_avengers/,1689886776.0," At first this seems like a smart question on the surface. Looking at it objectively however, just what are The Avengers supposed to do? Carol, Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, Sam, and Hawkeye are guys you call when you need to punch someone in the face. In fact, the only avengers who actually could be helpful are Rhodey with his government connections and Buckey. As we know Rhodey is the enemy and Buckey would be a liability if he was **once again** seen on TV doing something wrong. Shuri is not an Avenger, and the international community does not seem to be on good terms with Wakanda. I doubt Fury has any contacts with them. **These heroes are not detectives, and this situation is more of a who done it scenario. When you have a mystery to solve you don't call Superman, you call Batman and Nick Fury is the Batman of this universe.**

In the story Fury has given the audience multiple good reasons for not calling the Avengers for help. He explained to Skrull Rhodey that he didn't want to call them because the last thing you would want is a skrull taking their identity and doing something foul. A sentiment proven correct since Rhodey himself was a skrull.

The fact that Gravik wants the DNA of The Avengers is another damn good reason to keep them out of it. The Skrulls have proven that they can steal powers with Groot and Extremis. Last thing you need is them adding Carol and Hulk's powers from a stray strand of hair or blood. **Calling Dr.Strange or Wong might be the only legitimate criticism against Fury that I could understand because I don't know how much their magic abilities are tied into their DNA. After the crap that Wanda pulled, I would be hesitant to take that chance.**

People seemed pissed that Fury said he didn't want to ask for help because of personal reasons. I don't blame him. He wants to clean up his own mess and has just been betrayed by a group of people whom he asked for help in the past. He is a spy and spies don't trust people easy. **Also, Nick Fury, just like Batman, is a dick.**

Batman could call Superman to clean up Gotham, but he doesn't because he is a control freak, who doesn't trust anyone but himself to get the job done right. MCU Nick Fury and his comic counterpart are exactly the same. He formed the Avengers in the past, but he was in total control over those situations. He got each of them to do exactly what he wanted, even emotionally manipulating them with Coulson's death and keeping Carols existence in his back pocket. **He could have called Carol during The Battle of New York, but he didn't. Fury not using his ace right out the bag is on brand for his character.**

At the end of the day, you can like what you want. This show just may not be for you but complaining that Fury should ask the Avengers for help feels like something that sounds smart and obvious, but really isn't. It really feels like people just want another Avengers movie and are unfairly bashing this show when it comes to this one particular criticism."

Depowering her (at least somewhat) will help future MCU projects answer why she can't just show up and solve the issue.

She is overpowered for the following reasons:

* At this point, she is \~60 years old in the MCU but does not appear to have aged since she has received her power. Will she ever age or is she destined to be immortal/invulnverable?
* She can literally carry a spaceship throughout space (without needing any sort of outside assistance to survive in the vacuum of space). In Endgame she carried the ship containing Iron Man &amp; Nebula from the middle of nowhere to earth and did not appear to be phased at all from doing it. From Infinity Wars, we know that Titan required at least 1 jump through a wormhole so is she carrying the ship through a wormhole or just powergripping it the whole way?
* She was able to just one punch Thanos's fleet and didn't even need to rest after doing it.

The overpowering is causing weird omissions/leaps-of-logic like:

* Why didn't the Avengers tell her of the plan to get the stones in Endgame, or if they did, why didn't they wait for her to get to earth? For the movie's sake, it would have really changed what happened during Thanos's initial attack. Also, how was she able to get to earth during the battle? Did she hear what happened and flew millions of miles within an hour?
* How hasn't she found a planet for the Skrulls to live on? We know that she can fly throughout the universe and is helping multitudes of other planets. Yet she somehow hasn't found one that the Skrulls can live on? Her finding a planet would obviously make Secret Invasion null and void. Also, why isn't Fury calling Capt. Marvel? I'm sure she would like to know that the original species she helped is trying to destroy earth.

Ultimately, Capt. Marvel has the same weaknesses as Superman. It's extremely hard to build tension in a movie/character when they can just easily physically destroy nearly any threat.

Also, I fully expect to see a Marvel version of Mr. Mxyztplk in the Marvels as a comedic foil and way to show ""well Capt. Marvel can't physically beat this being but can outsmart it"".

"CALL OF FURY : "" Now is the time to finish this.."" (spoilers for SI5)",Quiet_Effective7234,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1564je0/call_of_fury_now_is_the_time_to_finish_this/,1689984191.0,"When I saw the final scene of episode 5 with Fury’s phone call telling the above, I naturally took it (like I suppose at least 90% of the viewers) that he was talking to Gravik, asking for a face-off in a bravado display… It made sense as he is supposed to bring him the Harvest to avoid the Nuclear strike on New Skrullos (and he is now armed with a handgun).

But then I was surprised to see on some threads that some people were asking themselves who Fury’s interlocutor could be..

Which got me thinking, even if the subtitles in that dialogue mentioned “Gravik”, could that be a deception from the writers (“imagine a world where no information could be trusted”?)? 

Could Fury have called someone else and given him/her the pre-agreed message to go on with the final stage of a secret master plan?

 If so, who could be the most likely and interesting candidates according to you?

 

Here is my list in order of eventual plausibility =

  
Varra/Priscilla Fury?
Fury repeatedly says that the whole thing was “personal” to him..
From the flashback scene at the beginning of episode2 we see Varra introducing young orphan Skrull to him, and immediately taking a motherly attitude with the youth.. As she later married Fury, maybe the both of them acted as surrogate parents of sorts to Gravik, and they could have worried seeing him radicalizing himself and getting obsessed with the concept of Super Skrull soldiers. So they would have worked early on a plan to oppose him in case he really went full psycho.. Remember Fury is Mr Paranoia in person.. This would fit nicely with my other theory I exposed earlier, that the Harvest actually is a bait/trap for Gravik and a contagious virus only affecting Skrulls to remove their shapeshifting abilities..

 

Soren?
We have never seen her die, so maybe “reports of her demise were greatly exaggerated” and she might have been working behind the scenes with Fury (and Talos?) to actively but discretely assemble and train a Counter-Resistance Skrull army to oppose Gravik..
Maybe she did appear already in the show, in that weird bar scene of episode 1 with the chess game and possibly coded dialogue, temporary posing as Maria Hill. The real Hill we see earlier and later (RIP) in the episode would not have needed to meet Fury in that public setting for that kind of conversation, as they were sharing the same apartment.

 

Talos?
We never really saw him fully die either.. Sure, there was that emotional scene of his incineration in the funerary rite performed by Varra and G’iah.. But how the hell could lonely Varra have gotten hold (especially so soon) of the body of a shapeshifting alien recovered from the site of an attempted killing/kidnapping of the US president? Surely that body would have been very safely kept under the strictest military watch.. Fooling G’iah is cruel, for sure, but Fury is a dick and would not have shied away from that manipulation to keep his plans secret..

 
Maria Hill?
Unsure about that one. This is just wishful thinking we have not seen the last of that great character and actress. I still grieve for that waste apparently just for sheer shock value in episode 1…

 
The fake Shirley Sagar (played by English actress seta Indrani), the only member of the Skrull Council (can’t remember if the occupation of her human template was ever mentioned) who bravely opposes Gravik’s coup (and is allowed to leave) 
I’m surprised we have not yet seen her again.. She definitely could have gone on to work for Fury and Talos to regroup Skrulls loyal to them and wanting a peaceful cohabitation with humans..

 
 
Totally out of the left field (not yet seen in previous episodes) = 

 
Monica Rambeau / Photon / Spectrum
She was recruited by Skrulls at the end of WandaVision and probably on the SABER space station  ( she will be there with Fury in The Marvels. She's known personally a few Skrulls including G'iah since she was a kid in 1995. Her light-base powers could be useful to Fury in the final battle to come. I wonder if she could use her powers to simply blind the Skrulls. Surely they would not be able to shapeshift into any new form if they couldn't see it first?


Smart Hulk / Banner?
imho he would be the only Avenger that would make sense Fury could call for help in that final confrontation = scientific knowledge (Banner started working on a government project to create super-soldiers, and is a polyvalent scientific genius), raw power that could match the Super Skrulls, and last but not least ability to survive nuclear radiations..

 
Sharon Carter / the Power Broker?
This is quite a stretch, obviously, and mainly just coming from her seemingly out-of-character role as the Power Broker in FatWS, with many theorizing she could be a Skrull. 
What if she was NOT a Skrull, but secretly working deep undercover for Fury to subtly indirectly infiltrate the Skrull Resistance? 
Her work as the Power Broker (and especially with the super soldier serum) would have gotten the interest of Gravik looking to create Super Skrulls. And her final phone call to a mysterious unknown person telling him that she will now have access to SHIELD/CIA weapons and technology so he should advise the “buyers” could have been addressed to someone like Pagon, with the buyers being Gravik &amp; co.. 
That would have allowed her to provide New Skrullos sabotaged/booby-trapped technology and parts for their machines, that could eventually be blown up (or whatever) remotely at the order of Fury (always a few steps ahead of Gravik the whole time) to “finish” it..
The possibility mentioned above that the “Maria Hill” from the bar scene could be an impostor to fool Fury’s followers could apply to Sharon (using a photostatic “Widow’s Veil”, something she was already showed using in FatWS) instead of Soren. Interestingly, Fury just casually dropped in a conversation with Sonya in episode5 that they have access to a newer version of the Veil allowing to disguise the appearance of the whole body (basically the equivalent of an “image inducer” like the one sometimes used by Nightcrawler among others in the comics). So Sharon could already be in New Skrullos using that device to pause as any of its known field agents. Infiltrating the infiltrators using their own trick against them…
Note that in the comics Fury used Sharon several times for these types of deep cover missions (explaining her temporary absence from the Captain America comics when some writers did not want to use her). And in the MCU she was shown to have a special relation with Fury in her first appearance in CA First Avengers, and especially in CA Winter Soldier.

 
 

Any other suggestion?

I’ll accept the AoS nostalgic fans to come up with their usual favorite characters (Coulson, Quake/Daisy, May/the Cavalry..) if they give us a good way to explain how it would make sense to have these introduced in a meaningful and interesting way to an audience that in its great majority never watched the 150+ (admittedly  mostly good) episodes of that non-Disney show and probably never will….

I think that it will have a big final battle with Sonya Falsworth, Fury, Varra, Giah and maybe a few of Gravik’s skrulls that have turned good all fighting Gravik and his ally skrulls. I think the harvest is going to play a pretty big role in this episode considering Gravik wants to use it on himself. I think it’s possible that Giah might use it. Which would make Giah one of the most over powered characters. And since this show seems to be killing everyone close to Fury, I think Varra might die during this battle. Gravik will definitely be killed by Giah. We will probably figure out what’s up with Rhodey and the real Rhodey might end up helping Fury. Possible setting up Armor Wars.  I don’t think Talos mentioned emperor Drogge for nothing, I think she might play a role in this episode or at least a post credit scene. There will definitely be a post credit scene setting up The Marvels. It will probably show Fury back on SABER and possibly with Monica paying off the WandaVision post credit scene and set her up to be in space."

Dumb things the MCU needs to fix.,wisconsinking,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/156ugid/dumb_things_the_mcu_needs_to_fix/,1690057883.0,"There's LOTS of things fans hate or think is weird about the MCU, some I've thought of some things that it needs to change to be better:

Nanotech fetish - by Love and Thunder I was annoyed d by it, for once can we get something else like liquid metal or something or at get a break from it?

Setting up stuff with no payoff - the MCU NEEDS to go back to doing solo projects, I'm fine setting up a sequel and team up stuff but I swear to God if any of the upcoming projects (The Marvels, Thunderbolts, Captain America 4, Loki s2, ect)sets up anything I'm DONE with the MCU... There's even rumors that Blade (though that movies never happening) is supposed to set up Blade's daughter.

Ms Marvel - her being a dime store Green Lantern is still dumb but if she's a mutant why does she still need those bracelets? They don't even enhance her powers.

Listen to the fans - you'd be surprised how much better stuff fans have come up with (head cannons, rewriting their own version of a movie/show, ect). Because of the fans we got the actor from The Office ad Mister Fantastic (though his character died).

*Another MCU project that's never going to happen is Fantastic Four, Marvel should cancel both that and Blade and turn them into MCU cannon comics or videogames."
"To those who have seen every single MCU movie/show. Answer me honestly, do you think marvel has gotten worse since endgame.

Not someone who's seen everything but doesn't mind watching something that looks interesting. My first MCU film was the first avengers and I've mostly followed everything up until endgame.

Now there have been some films I've seen like no way home, Dr strange MOM and secret invasion is pretty neat. But I will admit I have had some fatigue from marvel and haven't exactly seen a lot of the newer ones.

Now don't for a second think I'm trying to bad mouth Marvel just because I didn't watch Shang-chi. I feel like everyone who announces that they've ""stopped watching the MCU"" are the same kind of people to say vaping is better because it doesn't kill.

I don't think its fair to judge a franchises quality on how many people are watching/playing. So to those who watched every single MCU flick and followed up with every storyline. Is Marvel actually underperforming their work and putting less effort into it. Or are they still going strong and people have just grown a bit tired of Marvel?"
Why were the skrulls (a space faring race) relying on earthlings (mostly non space faring) to find them a new planet in the first place?,Zealousideal-Set-592,1276,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154pcai/why_were_the_skrulls_a_space_faring_race_relying/,1689855460.0,"So obviously Carol Danvers is the big exception to the rule and it's still not clear why she's apparently done fa but... Why did they think Fury could help them? I know that they were refugees and had limited space transport but they still had way more than Earth did! Both in terms on knowledge and capability. Why, with Fury's help, did they not improve their crafts and search themselves? The 1 million skrulls apparently had the ability to make it to Earth in the first place. Why have they sat around for the past 30 years not trying to help themselves at all? Once Carol Danvers had buggered off, what exactly was Fury supposed to do? How would he know of more suitable planets than they did? When Thor showed up, I guess he could have asked for some help there but, so could Talos himself. Or any of the other skrulls? Why just sit about waiting for help that's obviously not coming?"

The suspense of not knowing who is real and who is a Skrull has been missing a little bit. I still like SI overall, but agree that the extreme paranoia that could have been present has been missing just a little.

I think that, with one episode left, the series will wrap up Gravik, but leave the question over the Skrulls still open for future movies to deal with a wrap up. I think that's where we may see more Super Skrulls, for the actual powered heroes to deal with. we may even see some of this in the Marvels movie that is coming up. In my opinion this would make be a great way to use SI as a springboard for the upcoming movies, and keep that paranoia going for a little bit.

Is it better that Disney will give the Marvel cinematic universe a hiatus after Avengers: The Kang Dynasty or secret wars,trover2345325,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/156cph7/is_it_better_that_disney_will_give_the_marvel/,1690008756.0,"Everyone, with problems in the Hollywood like the ongoing writers- SAG- AFTRA strike that cause delays to various projects in the Hollywood entertainment industry, not to mention superhero films are on a decline due to fatigue and end up as box office bombs   that Hollywood might move away from the superhero hype and instead focus on toy and video game adaptations instead since super mario and Barbie are become box office hits because superhero moves are a trend and soon to be one of the tired trends that people might move on .

&amp;#x200B;

Is it likely that Disney give the marvel cinematic universe a hiatus for a few years by making phase five as the finale of the MCU before giving it a hiatus , meaning that Avengers: The Kang Dynasty  or Secret wars will instead be a phase five movie and the grand finale of the current MCU instead.

&amp;#x200B;

Because the reason , is that the recent MCU movies (even DC ones) did not become box office hits that the studio envisioned, people are bored and moved on and now toys and video games movies adaptations are the next thing , so they will likely give the MCU a hiatus after Avengers: The Kang Dynasty which will be retooled as the finale instead or just  Secret wars and will revive it again few years later with a new MCU series starting with the fantastic four and the X-men  in a new Phase 1 to reboot the series (since fantastic four started the current marvel universe) with new actors and a new saga.

Has the MCU Unintentionally Made the Fantastic Four Redundant?,thedrifter129,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154v8sp/has_the_mcu_unintentionally_made_the_fantastic/,1689869401.0,"In the comics, the Fantastic Four is Marvel's First Family and often the cornerstone of the MU.  What the first Iron Man was to Marvel movies is what FF was to Marvel comics. Part of their success was bending the rules of the superhero genre; the FF were more explorers than superheroes, they had no secret identity, one of them was turned into a monster who hated himself and there was the family dynamic between team members.  The success of FF allowed Lee/Kirby to expand the Marvel universe even further and to also bring back older characters like the android Human Torch, Captain America and Namor.    

The FF was where Kree (including Ronan), the Skrulls, Inhumans, Galactus. Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer were introduced thus setting the stage for the Marvel Cosmic where characters like the Nova Corps, the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos would thrive.    The FF is also where Black Panther was introduced, Namor was revived and when Lee/Kirby wanted to test the waters for a Cap revival, they did a one shot where Johnny Storm met a Captain America impersonator (and yes it's wild they ended up being played by the same actor years later).       

The MCU grew differently than the MU, largely because Marvel Studios didn't have the rights to their characters.  In the MCU narrative, the Pym Family now occupies the role of superhero-scientist family.   Will the MCU shy away from the Negative Zone because  its too 'similar' to the Quantum Zone? The Skrulls and Kree have been given to Fury and Carol respectively. Time travelling has been given to Stark.   Will it be exciting to see Galactus and the Silver Surfer when you have already seen the Celestials in Eternals?  Are we going to have another Secret Invasion, story arc since Reed is usually the dude who works on exposing the Skrulls?   The Watchers have already been introduced separately in What If.    Namor, Spider-Man and Black Panther exist separately and it's up in there if we will ever get to see them interact with the FF.    To me it's going to be weird if the FF turns out to be the Junior Team of MCU 199999. This is a world where the FF wasn't around for Skrulls, Thanos, Civil War or Wakanda opening up to the world and where Spider-Man has already been in 6 movies already and the actor is ready to call it quits. The question; what is there left for the FF to explore? Can they actually be a force to be reckoned with in the MCU?  And how do you think the MCU will explain their absence?

The humour, underuse of Christain Bale, and a couple other things come to mind. 

However, after listening to the L&amp;T score, I came to realize that maybe the movie was meant to be bad. 

Now before I lose your attention, think about it. The entire movie really lacked any sort of 'meat'. But in one of the final scenes where the reach eternity and Thor gives up his pursuit on Gorr, and then we get a brief moment of seriousness from Thor. Whether or not you liked the movie as a whole, you have to admit this was a very important moment for Thor's development as a character. 

Now Thor is a father, and I feel like we may be moving into a new era for Thor, with all the goofiness left behind in Thor L&amp;T. Will Thor movies still have humour? Yes. But that doesn't mean the tone of the movies can't shift as Thor develops as a character.

Sorry for my shitty writing skills and my bad explanations. It honestly sounded better in my head and was just a brief thought that came over me when the score turned from fun and energetic to soft and emotional. Also hope this hasn't already been pointed out by someone else on here."
Thor should've been with the Guardians in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,JoeTheOneFan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155ujc7/thor_shouldve_been_with_the_guardians_in/,1689960713.0,"There I said it. Seriously, what was the point of Thor joining the Guardians in *Avengers: Endgame* when they do nothing about it. Anthony and Joe Russo should've talked to Taika Waititi and James Gunn about what to do with Thor and the Guardians since he joined them in Endgame. Besides Thor didn't even know that he left the Guardians in *Thor: Love and Thunder* and now, he has his daughter Love and his home Midgard. *Thor: Love and Thunder* was an unneeded project that's why it flopped. 

Look, I like Thor a lot in his films but imagine how much Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 would've been awesome if Thor joined. We were robbed with a fight between Will Poulter's Adam Warlock vs. Thor fight and It would've been so emotional if Thor tried to save Rocket. 

Also, *Thor: Ragnarok* should've concluded the Thor trilogy and Thor should've stayed with the Guardians after that. It's just stupid."

Theory: Daisy Johnson isn't back in Secret Invasion like everyone thinks/hopes she is - she's actually back in The Marvels.,no_not_luke,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155tt7r/theory_daisy_johnson_isnt_back_in_secret_invasion/,1689959081.0,"I'm fully aware that I'm a delusional *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.* fan. I'm also aware that Feige called the series canon not [once](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m5e39EbGc1w&amp;t=118s), but [twice](https://www.slashfilm.com/537489/agents-of-shield-age-of-ultron-plot-hole/) (covering at least the first two seasons there) and has never said anything to the contrary, so there's more than enough room for characters to return *should Marvel want to*. It's that last part that's questionable. Many of us thought Marvel might play their hand in *Secret Invasion*; as happy as that would have made me, I could never quite picture it coming to pass (and while the crowd favorite to return has been Daisy, I thought it much more likely to see someone like Coulson or Mack). At this point, I don't see any of those happening...but I don't see all hope as being lost for future MCU releases, namely the next big movie.

What helps is that there have been some leaks that hint at a possibility of mining some of what AoS brought to the MCU. My theory doesn't rely on them but *is* supported by them, so I'll be including them after the foundation of the theory and **only** behind spoiler walls. I'll also preface what they actually spoil (and how much of a ""spoiler"" they really are) like I did above, so you can pick and choose which to see. (Not treating anything in a trailer as a spoiler.) Anyway, let's get into the conjecture of it all.

*The Marvels* is positioned to be Marvel Studios' first all-female team-up movie, crossing Earth and space to throw superpowered side-effects like teleportation at the heroes.. We'll see Fury return, this time in charge at S.A.B.E.R. in Earth orbit. In one way or another, these folks will run afoul of the Kree, whom will probably be defeated by the power of the main trio's collective girlbossery. Here's where I think Daisy could fit in:

* *Marvels* will be a significantly space-based movie; whether AoS was still in 199999 by the last scene of S7 or had branched into a new timeline with S6 (when the Snap was a little conspicuously left out of the story), both endings have Daisy aboard a space-travel-equipped craft.
* A Fury-run government agency will be involved in *The Marvels*; Daisy became a core member of the last government force Fury ran.
* The Kree will feature as enemies in the movie; Daisy has come face-to-face with the Kree on multiple fields and for multiple reasons.
* The film is clearly going for a ""girlboss"" vibe; anyone who's seen AoS can tell you that Daisy is pretty much the epitome of whatever the definition of ""girlboss"" is lol.

I'm not here to say Daisy is the secret fourth headliner of the movie or anything, but if Fury wants anyone to be on his S.A.B.E.R. callsheet, it's going to be the girl with superpowers who's tangled with multiple alien threats and has proven herself able to be trusted. Daisy can at least brush shoulders with a main character in a S.A.B.E.R. hallway or be the one to brief them in such a scene. Or, if nothing else, give Monica a line about her coworker and friend Daisy Johnson.

(I'd also do anything to see FitzSimmons doing a little space tourism/research on S.A.B.E.R. with Arya in tow, but I don't want to ask too much of Marvel.)

Now for the leaks, so proceed with caution if you want to maintain maximum surprise.

Let's start with MyTimeToShineHello, a leaker with a respectable track record over the last couple years, who \[[possible spoiler for future MCU event](https://twitter.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1547692836329377796?s=20)\] &gt;!straight-up announced Quake's return in no uncertain terms!&lt; (the deleted tweet to which MTTSH was responding was asking about Quake). There are multiple other hints, like this one \[[same as other warning](https://twitter.com/AlexFromCC/status/1662798616803565568?s=20)\] &gt;!alluding to any one (or more) of the agents from S.H.I.E.L.D.!&lt;. Could they be lying (for whatever reason, since they haven't before), have bad info, or could plans have changed? Absolutely. (I mean, these tweets could even still apply to *Secret Invasion*, but I've let that one hope go myself.) But we take what we can get, and both reports come from reputable places - or at least as reputable as they can get in that sphere.

Additionally, other reports - not from those accounts, but from decent leakers corroborated by someone I trust in the industry with an ear on the ground - have indicated \[vague *Marvels* spoilers\] &gt;!we may see other fan-favorite heroines that don't have immediately obvious ties to the core characters. I won't say who here just because those are 100% spoilers, but they're out there to be found on the web. So we already have multiple characters without strong ties to main characters appearing in the movie because they're fan-favorite female characters. Well, trust me when I tell you that Daisy is even more connected to Fury and the heroes of this movie than the ""confirmed"" appearing characters are themselves (especially if you buy the theory that Marvel would retcon Daisy's Inhuman origin for reasons similar to why they subverted Kamala's), and if they're going for fan-favorite characters, the hype for Daisy to appear in SI has proven that it doesn't get much more ""fan favorite"" than Quake - at least in the right circles.!&lt;

And that's the sum of why I think the chance of Daisy Johnson making her triumphant return to the MCU is most likely to take place in *The Marvels* of all Marvel's announced projects: it just makes the most sense. There's reasons upon reasons for her to be present, whereas there'd be some shoehorning needed for most other upcoming releases. If this comes to pass, then it's just a matter of whether the story of AoS remains intact, or if they retcon it to be a branch of 199999. Honestly, I'm fine with it being a branch anywhere after the first episode. Just don't let the founding event of the series, Coulson's resurrection, be undone in the MCU. That's my only ask of Marvel, after actually acknowledging the series itself. Curious to see how I, and any of you, will feel looking back on this in four months!"

My first thought was Millie Bobby Brown because she's a great actress who's not in the MCU yet and she's young enough to play Love. What other actresses do you guys have in mind? I also decided to edit the marks onto a picture of Millie to see what it would look like. It was rushed so don't judge my editing skills lol.

Secret Invasion is flexing itself as Marvel's Andor and largely failing,junaidnoori,2096,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15429ri/secret_invasion_is_flexing_itself_as_marvels/,1689789903.0,"I was excited when this show was announced as I was a fan of the Secret Invasion storyline in the comics and I'm a big fan of espionage films/shows/books. 

This show has so far been dull, uninspired, directionless and just plain bad. It's as if the showrunners watched Tinker, Tailor (or another John LeCarre film) and thought prestige television meant having two people have a conversation in a room about something boring. That's not what those scenes are for! They're using conversation as a means of gathering information from each other and reveal something about the characters we don't know already. Here, they don't do anything.

There are entire scenes that go nowhere. At no point are you aware of what a character desires or how they're going to get it. In Andor, we get to see the banality of evil and how an insurgency is first formed. We see the conflict from all sides and how there are several ways of being opporessed. What this show should've done is help the viewer understand why Skrulls feel oppressed by a system that requires them to maintain human form in public. At no point does the audience feel sympathy for their plight. We're not told why Gravik suddenly decided to take a big swing and why are so many Skrulls in favor of it. What was the catalyst?

I really hope after this strike ends that Marvel employs better showrunners and gives them enough latitude to do their own thing in the future."

What if there were no more movies and the MCU turned into a long running tv show throughout half the year?,Unusual-Math-1505,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1562k0r/what_if_there_were_no_more_movies_and_the_mcu/,1689979044.0,"I think if they do this then they could cut down on costs so things aren’t as expensive.

Mainly though it would make the storytelling streamlined and people could keep up with it more easily.

There are too many characters now and some are just getting abandoned such as white vision who we haven’t seen in nearly 3 years. This one long running tv show could combine everything and make it more streamlined. And it would be easier to keep track of where everyone is and the general timeline of everything.

You can have long running arcs for each season that won’t be limited to the 6 episode/4 hour content. Everything would have more time to breathe.

Half the season could be devoted to standalone episodes and then the other half can be dedicated to the more ensemble projects. 

Overall I think this could be an upgraded version of the 2012 animated Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes mixed with a game of thrones type production.

What suggestions and thoughts do you all have about this?"

"theory: the Harvest, a viral vial? (spoilers for SI5)",Quiet_Effective7234,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1555ct1/theory_the_harvest_a_viral_vial_spoilers_for_si5/,1689891994.0,"SO, episode 5 ends with Fury all suited up, eyepatched and armed with a handgun, all ready to go to the radioactive New Skrullos before it gets nuked by the US, to single handedly confront Gravik and a platoon of Super Skrulls..  He must be confident and think this is not a trap but a face off..
And of course he brings with him the legendary Harvest, which could give Gravik the powers of Earth's mightiest heroes...


I have another theory, that would be more in line with the character of the old Nick we know.

I say the green liquid vial does not and probably never did contain the ( combined??) DNA of the Avengers, but is just a bait for Gravik., and actually contains the means to defeat the latter, as well as a possible solution to find a home to the Skrulls on Earth...

I believe Nick and Varra raised young Skrull Gravik like their son, and saw his getting impatient and radicalized, imagining where it could lead him, so they plotted a contingency plan against his possible going full psychopath mode..
Surely Fury would have known that although ruthless and committed, Gravik was not the brightest apple in the bunch, so he could easily have manipulated him and make him believe in that the blood he sent him retrieve after the final battle in Endgame would be made into that ""Harvest"" macguffin .. 
Seriously, I am certainly not a science expert but I have a hard time imagining how multiple DNA samples from hundreds of fighters in that huge battlefield could be all mixed into a single liquid and be used to duplicate the powers of the Avengers.. But it certainly would have been an irresistible grail for Gravik and his dreams of creating Super Skrulls...

So what could there be in that vial that Fury plans Gravik will inject himself with?

I say it could be an hybrid alien virus.

Possibly one that only affects Skrulls by making it impossible for them to shapeshift, having them stuck forever in the shape they had when they contracted that virus... Think of the Mutant Cure, but for Skrulls, as a virus spreading by contact or breathing. A sort of Mad Skrull Cow disease 😁..
Something like that does happen in the comics when the detonation of the "" Hyperwave bomb""  ( created by some Skrulls themselves) suddenly cause all Skrulls to lose their shapeshifting powers, and it causes the start of the second Kree-Skrull war...

It would be a fitting punishment for Gravik to not only be unable to use his powers and shapeshift, but be forever condemned to live as a human and be responsible for spreading that plague to all other Skrulls he would meet, transforming them into permanent "" locals""...

And it could be a way for Skrulls willing to do so to embrace humanity and be accepted and possibly beloved on this Earth..


Last but not least, who could create that virus/cure if not Varra?
We were never told what the specialty of her friend ( and maybe colleague on a top secret scientific  project) Dr Priscilla Davis ( called "" professor"" in episode 5) was..
I thought she could be a geneticist because I liked the idea Varra and Pris could have worked to give birth to Hulkling as the first Kree/Skrull hybrid.
But maybe she was an epidemiologist / biologist...
And possibly a botanist.. We do see a lot of plants in Varra's house, and we were told about Soren's seeding of alien plants.."

But I’d assume that not every Skrull was lucky enough to befriend a dying human and take their form. 

We know that Gavik and his crew abducted important humans and replaced them. But what about the regular Skrulls who aren’t a part of his plans, or those who worked with Talos? What happened to those humans? 

I suppose some Skrulls took the forms of people who were off the grid or had no personal attachments, such as homeless people or lone wolves. But I don’t think a million Skrulls could pull that off."

After Talos’ funeral, Priscilla mentions “the snap”. When I heard it, it seemed off and took a few seconds to register. As the audience looking in, I think we generally continue referring to the end of Infinity War as the snap, but within the MCU, I don’t think it’s ever been called anything other than “the blip”. 

Has the MCU referred to the event as the snap before? Maybe a small writing slip? Not deep — just an observation that’s been lingering in my head."

The Disney+ series haven’t had a lot of great reviews but I do believe there’s lot of great potential for good story telling if the MCU fans had a say in what kind of stories should be told to the viewers. 

Also we never really got to see the TV series like Agents of Shield and the Netflix Defenders crossover with each other as well as the Avengers, wider MCU and Spider-Man. 

I briefly spoke to Mike Colter (Luke Cage) at comic con and asked him if there were any plans to have Luke Cage join the Avengers. He said nothing as of yet and that he has about 3 years of his contract left so Marvel would need to contact him quickly if they were to include his character. It does create some uncertainties about seeing the rest of the Defenders coming back but I’m hoping that Marvel come to a deal and can bring back the other Netflix Defenders along with Daredevil. 

Or do you think the MCU should be rebooted but this time everybody comes back? (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Spider-Man, Agents of Shield, Defenders, Avengers). Would be good to hear everyone’s feedback of the MCU and what we’d like to see in the MCU going forward."

Secret Invasion is one of them. Aside from the name and the basic concept of a Skrull invasion, it's a completely original story with pretty much no resemblance to the original source material. The Marvel Zombies episode of What If? was also pretty much a completely original story with the only things they kept being the basic concept and T'Challa being used as zombie food. I'm wondering if anyone would be down for them to go all out and make a completely original movie or show? For example if they made up a brand new superhero and villain and made a movie or show about that, would you be cool with that? Honestly I would be into it.

How would you change the mcu?,trackerjacker666,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155cpyt/how_would_you_change_the_mcu/,1689911952.0," 

Basically the question how would you go about the movies/phases. Would it be different or similar? I did something similar with just the first four phases but here is my full timeline

Phase 1:

* Iron man- pretty much the same except maybe no identity reveal (if i could have a younger iron man thinking chris pine)
* Iron man-no whiplash maybe crimson dynamo instead
* Hulk -pretty much the same (kinda want to see how Jamie Dornan would play Bruce banner though)
* Captain America- pretty much the same except maybe get a little bit of an older cap like hitting 30 instead of early 20s like the movie tried to do to show the affect of being in war for years.
* Thor- with the thor movies they'd all be dramatically different in the sense I'd want to change the genre for every one. This would be a mystery/action with Donald Blake trying to figure out what his weird dreams about being a Norse god are about.
* Avengers- the main villain would be masters of evil (the villains are all former villains from the old movie teaming up). Iron man identity reveal at the end

Phase 2

* Iron man 3- this but with the real mandarin
* Captain America 2 serpent society: plot twist though the serpent society are actually skrulls and they've been controlling the government and framed captain America the end is with him going on the run. (Lol lizard ppl run the government)
* Thor 2- the genre here would be horror and feature a physical split at the end of avengers of Donald Blake and Thor except donald Blake goes crazy and got on a killing spree of everyone connected to thor making him feel powerless. (This is based off the Thor #11 comic from 2020 my personal new favorite comic)
* Yellow jacket- hank pym is yellow jacket cuz it's my favorite persona he had. But hank pym is basically a workaholic man who hates the idea of the avengers.
* Hulk 2- the cube has a massive breakout and the hulk has to stop it
* Hawkeye- introduces Hawkeye as the circus kid turned criminal who has to learn he has a bigger role to play. (Maybe some references to captain America 2)
* Black widow- black widow is an assassin who is trying to be taken down by government operative... Hawkeye
* Captain America 3- captain America proves his innocence by the end
* Fury- plays off the events of captain America where Nick fury has to fight the skrull secret invasion. He thinks he's done it but then he learns that the issue is much bigger than it seems... (Talks about a previous Skrull invasion years ago but he had captain marvel to help)
* Hulk 3- Ross who is basically pissed at banner creates red hulk serum and aims to kill the hulk.
* Black panther- a coup d'etat in wakanda leads an ending of tchalla seeking out the help of the avengers
* Thor 3- this will be primarily action with a little bit of drama. In Thor 1 the enchantress (the main villain of that movie) reveals to the loyal Loki that he's actually not Asgardian. Although out of love for Asgard and his brother he stays. Overtime though as he realizes Thor doesn't want to be king and his father refusing to give him the position because of his frost giant origins (even though the movie will play it clear as him being perfectly capable) he starts to turn against Asgard and it will be brother vs brother. I expect this to be much sadder as we had 2 movies of brother growth already. We also learn Loki as a means to distract Thor has been giving powerful and dangerous weapons to mortals such as Ulysses klawe (who helped overthrow wakanda).
* Avengers 2- following Thor 2 Loki attacks the earth. The 4 from the previous as well as the new 4 from the new movies team up to stop him. It ends with them defeating Loki and going to kick out the new dictators of wakanda.

Phase 3:

* Iron man: armor wars- basically the name
* Black panther 2- black panther 2 but with tchalla as the protagonist
* Black widow and Hawkeye- a sequel to both movies but now as a team up (I'm gonna start making dual movies/sequels so this would be considered both black widow 2 and Hawkeye 2) main villain will be local villain kingpin who has gotten a little too involved in foreign affairs for just a New York villain causing these two heroes to step in.
* Hulk 4- plays off of hulk 3 where banner learns Ross is red hulk causing an extreme feeling of betrayal considering he's his father in law. Hulk in this anger does a little too much destruction and introduce hulk buster.
* Thor: Ragnarok- thor 4 plays into the fall of Asgard and Thor accepting his responbilites as king. Revealed thor and jane break up. Mjolnir destroyed.
* Fury 2: secret invasion- playing off the events of the last movie fury realizes he can't defeat the skrulls but can expose them leading to the world finding out about the invasion.
* Quicksilver and the scarlet witch- introducing my favorite x men villains turned heroes
* Captain America and the winter soldier- cap finds out bucky is alive and tries to hunt him down.
* Yellow jacket and the wasp- this one will be like quantumania except obviously no Scott Lang or hope. Ends with hank realizing there needs to be better protections on the world he contacts Bruce banner and Tony stark to form ultron
* Avengers 3- ultron is a shit show. One year later we see ultron has taken over the world and the avengers (along with their 4 new members yellow jacket, wasp, and the maximoff siblings) make one last stand against him. leads to the death of coulson, old Peggy, maria hill, and Betty Ross causing a fraction and mistrust between the avengers for creating Ultron in the first place. They also discover at the ends ultron had something called the vision protocol. Something half want to look into the other half don't

Phase 4 (possibly my shortest phase)

* Hulk vs Thor (hulk and Thor 5)- after hulk went berserk in the last movie and is feeling getridden in his creation of Ultron banner barely wants to come out and the world has turned against him. Thor hates banner for helping create ulton as a lot of the final stand fighting happened in new Asgard so a lot of his people died as the hulk raged against Ultrons forces. Culminates In Steve Rogers asking hulk to start to operate independently and Tony stark asking thor to help take down hulk. Hulk is beat by Thor and is sent away in a spaceship with the space stone as it is too dangerous to be left on earth and needs to be hidden. This leads to the public hating both Thor and hulk. So Tony asks Thor to leave earth which he does.
* Spiderman- a few months after Ultrons defeat a junior year peter Parker becomes spiderman and faces the shocker. Dates Liz Allan but breaks up also introduces gwen stacy. Also meets Tony stark. In post credit scene harry osborne returns from an exchange program
* Captain America and the falcon (cap 5 and falcon 1)- captain America and the falcon team up to get bucky pardoned. leaving mistrust with the public and both heroes.
* Vision protocol- fury, black widow, Tony stark, black panther, and wasp want to operate the vision protocol. Tony thinks this is the way in order to makeup for what he did with Ultron. Meanwhile captain America, Hawkeye, hank, quicksilver, and scarlett witch want to not use it. Hank thinks the avengers should stop in these risky defense moves. Steve agrees. Vision is made anyways.
* Avengers civil war- after the creation of vision the government wants the avengers to be controlled by them. Team iron man makers agree saying it's only fair as they feel responsible for a lot of these terrible events. Team captain America although they also blame themselves they also note they didn't want vision to be created and think government control on heroes is bad. Years of mistrust is finally unleashed leading to a battle. Falcon and winter soldier join team caps avengers. Spiderman and vision join team starks. Ends with winter soldier dying, black widow betraying her team but turning herself in, hank refusing to fight his wife so he turns himself in, falcon wants to operate independently so he goes on the run, and captain America, Hawkeye, quicksilver, and scarlet witch becomes the secret avengers (avengers on the run as criminals but still do good deeds). Tchalla has to leave to become king of wakanda. Vision decides the superhero life isn't for him. Leaving the avengers as iron man, wasp, fury, and spiderman.

Phase 5

* Guardians of the galaxy- More like the second movie introducing star lord, gamora, rocket, groot, drax, mantis, adam warlock, and nebula. Although not part of the team introduces Jesse Alexander and Richard rider with richard rider sacrificing himself.
* Dr. Stange- just like the movie
* Planet Hulk- Like the animated film with a post credit scene of thor arriving at sakaar warning him of a threat coming for the space stone. Banner and hulk share control.
* Black Panther 3: Revolution- Reverend Achebe attempts to lead a coup in wakanda
* Iron Man 5: Demon in a bottle- Iron mans old foes come to face him after the civil war incident and tony clear starts to develop ptsd and a drinking problem
* Spiderman: Poison strike- Scorpion shows up in peter's senior year. Peter dates gwen. In post credit scene norman osborn shows up (it would be cool to see andrew garfield take the role).
* Wasp: Revelations- Wasp becomes her own hero as she takes on mandrill. 
* Fury And the last stand- Fury finally ends the skrull conflict on earth.

Is sonya falsworth a comic character?,sayamemangdemikian,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154gpcf/is_sonya_falsworth_a_comic_character/,1689826898.0,"Played by olivia colman in secret invasion. Was she in the comic cos I cant find any. Or is she original creation for MCU?

Colman did amazing. Like basically teaching all these MCU actors on how to act. Sonya is like Amanda Waller if amanda waller super cool, british, witty, and super cool.

I still felt cheated cos what happened to Hill just too soon.. (sigh, cant she has more episodes?? Why was colbie always only given 2 mins of screentime on any show she was in??).. but man Sonya has been a highlight that i look forward to on every episode. 

It's cool if she was original creation. But even if she is new..  is she even based on anything in marvel comics?"

As we all know, there is a lot of variations in episode runtimes in MCU shows...same issue with its most recent one, Secret Invasion...

Idk about other regions but in mine the episode runtimes are as follows

1-52 mins

2-55 mins

3-41 mins

4-35 mins

&gt;!5-36 mins!&lt;

In total thars 3.39 hrs...now the finale episode will most probably be max one hour..and we can say the total duration would be 4.40 hrs, or 4.30 hrs if it's in the 50 mins range, or even less...

And then there are 4-5 mins worth of recaps, credits , opening etc....minus all that and we will get a 4 - 4.15 hrs worth of content when these shows are themselves promoted as "" six hour movies""...which basically means they aren't 

This is also the case in all of the shows, which i think are a bit longer than this, making this one of the shortests or maybe the shortest one...
Whats your opinion on this?

With the new stills released it looked so good and some shots actually looked visually appealing.

Showcasing Monica's power looked so cool, Carol flying around, and the rainy looking environment between Monica and Carol looks nice and looks like we're gonna get some serious talk between this two in the Movie.

Overall I'm now even more excited for this film to come out and I hope the new trailer is gonna be a huge improvement from the last."
I just finished Infinity War for the first time and I am speechless,Hamza9236,2629,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153flk6/i_just_finished_infinity_war_for_the_first_time/,1689726884.0,"Probably should give some background here, I was never really much of a superhero guy, and I only just saw the first Spider-Verse movie a few months ago before watching ATSV, but I had seem some Marvel movies in the past, mostly the Black Panther ones and Guardians 2 since my dad was somewhat of a fan of them while I was in my Star Wars phase.

Then Guardians 3 came out and a bunch of people in a Discord server I was in was singing it's praises, saying out it was one of the last good Marvel movies, which had me intrigued. So what did I do? On May 13, I went to Disney+, and watched both the first and second Iron Man movies (Hulk wasn't on the service yet, so... ☠️). Suffice to say, I was more than interested after enjoying the first Iron Man plenty, and while the second didn't really deliver, it showed me there was some potential and a place for this franchise to go.

So over the course of the next two months I've been binging Marvel movies and even took the liberty of ranking of them, and slowly, but surely, getting invested in the numerous characters I was being slowly introduced too, and tagging along for the ride. 

Jump to July 18th of 2023, and I finished Infinity War in full for the first time. I won't lie here, this film nearly brought me to tears at the end and I can't think of much words to describe. While each of the other films preceding this have their fair share of problems, whether it'd be just one or numerous, with Infinity War, I have absurdly little to critique about it. My heartstrings were being tugged at during the final half hour like you wouldn't believe.

Now I know how all of the fans have been feeling waiting for this to come out since the release of Iron Man or whichever movie came out the year you were introduced to the MCU, and how everyone felt by the end of the movie after the massive buildup it had going for ten years.

This was a 10/10, undoubtedly the best MCU movie, and I don't think I'll stop singing my praises, and can't wait to see Endgame soon."

You're telling Skrulls have been doing this probably before the MCU even began and you're gonna give us only 6 episodes?

The series deserves to be longer and have the time it needs to be perfect.

I love how the series is progressing so far but I'm a little disappointed how majority MCU Disney+ Shows  always gets 6 episodes.

I have a feeling alot more of the plot would've been added if it wasn't just 6 episodes making it more limited to tell this storyline.

Imagine WandaVision being only 6 episodes now that would've sucked."

DNA from IW &amp; Thor 2 was fair game for The Harvest, cuz that was how they got the DNA for two of the four, right?  So even if ALL of ""new"" Thanos vanished in the Snap, the original body/DNA would remain...

Might be a way for the MCU to bring back one of their most iconic (and marketable) villains.

Maybe he really IS inevitable...!"

This moment in Guardians of The Galaxy Volume 3 (Spoilers ahead),le_krou,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153wjwt/this_moment_in_guardians_of_the_galaxy_volume_3/,1689776801.0,"When Kraglin struggles to manipulate Yondu's arrow, while Knowhere is under attack by The High Evolutionary, he sees Yondu as a ghost for the last time and tells him what he told to Peter in Volume 2 how he handles the arrow with his heart and not his brain. Shortly after seeing Yondu's ghost telling exactly the same words, he's able to decimate the High Evolutionary's army.

Did anybody else felt like it was a Star Wars moment of Yoda teaching Luke about The Force or just me ?

Nonetheless I find it amazing once again how that was well delivered and solved because I couldn't have had it if Kraglin still couldn't master this ability by the end of the trilogy."
Favorite Amazement Scene,TheJTEHart,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154hju4/favorite_amazement_scene/,1689829627.0,"Of all the movies and TV shows in the MCU, what is considered your favorite scene of amazement? To give clarification this involves any scene that gives the viewer the sense of wonder such as Steve Rogers transformation, or Tony Starks first suit-up, or even the first glimpse of Wakanda in Black Panther and etc.
Personally my favorite of these scenes has to be our first tour of Talokan. The sense of scale while also showcasing its differences from Wakanda and other mythical/mystical places was astounding. The music and real emotion on peoples faces was absolutely beautiful, I actually teared up with the music (personally I love latin influenced music) and it helped me believe in Namor and his people. I really can’t wait to see him and Talokan again."
The Marvels looks out of place for the Multiverse Saga.,calebsairpods,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155eq53/the_marvels_looks_out_of_place_for_the_multiverse/,1689918081.0,"I watched the trailer. First thing I noticed is Carol casually mentioning that she’s just sitting in space…not helping the Skrulls. 

Second, the villain of this movie looks like another “outer space villain coming to end the world”. I know she’s Kree and she has the other half of Kamala’s bangle, but what is she *really* doing here?

Monica Rambeau is gonna be the star of the movie just by seeing her leader attitude facing Carol Danvers because she’s grown up now, especially the tension between them hinted in WandaVision.

I just didn’t see how this connects to the bigger picture. Maybe that’s not what the trailers are for anymore, but are we seriously going from Secret Invasion to this movie? It’s very Disney+ and redundant to the Multiverse Saga.

Edit: The problem i’m noticing in Phase Five is these shows and movies Marvel is putting out is framed in a way where it’s like “watch this to see the how this character’s storyline ends” and not “watch this to see the culmination of the Multiverse Saga”. They’re still carrying that epilogue attitude we felt in Phase Four. It’s tiring and the message of the Multiverse Saga gets lost the more we see this type of content."

&gt;!Every Mutant from before the events of Secret Invasion is either a Skrull or a human who escaped the compound or were sneaked out when they were young. Wanda and Pietro were two such escapees and their relation with Magneto begins in the compound when he helps them escape.!&lt;

Well, there's an episode in the 2000 series that shows, I don't remember very well but I think she was the leader of a village, I don't know, but I know she was African, I also know that she was once queen of Uakanda (I don't know how to write ) and she's been through a lot, so marvel should take advantage of her rich history and make a movie.

Hello! My name is Nick and i am just random guy, and i wanna share my idea for Tony Stark/Iron Man character and maybe hope, it will go viral somehow, because i beileve its good, so here we go! **(Sorry for my bad english in advance)**

**- Real Name:** Anthony Edward Stark  
**-** **Alias(es):** Iron Man, Infinity Knight, Protector Of Earth, Guardian Of Multiverse  
**-** **Species/Gender:** Male Human (Enchanted by Infinity Power, similar to Infinity Stones) 

**Story:** *Pretty much stays similar to Iron Man origin in  beginning, very normal...just another world with Avengers and this stuff, but when comes to Civil War Event in this realm...it turn down bad, very bad...Tony Stark try his best, but in that time...he was forced to kill his pregnant wife with his own armor, that he makes to protect her...in that moment...Stark changed forever, he was going nuts...Civil War then was about to stop Tony, because he was about to destroy everything in his way...kills milions even, we really see reflection of Ultron in this way...in Tony, after the event...when he almost kill Peter Parker/Spider-Man, he realized what he done and disappear...after maybe one month, we see Tony destryoing himself alone around nothing but alcohol...he was going to kill himself, he knows he deserves death...but something happend, something that shouldn't hav ...but did, he was chosen...how or why? dont know...but he was and gets absolutely new path, powers and everything...he was confused, scared and everything...but sees it as second chance to redeem himself, he gets back to Avengers, he become more stronger than everyone, battle with sooo many new enemies and everything and new version Of Tony Stark was created...The Infinity Knight!*

*That was the basic story and then i make so many for him...he was actually having romantic moments with Scarlet Witch and fell in love with each other like Knight and Witch, but then...in that story, Tony Stark actually found out...Wanda was multiversal threat, that needs to stop in future....and his destiny as Infinity Knight was actually destroy Scarlet Witch, Tony Stark was broken again...in that moment*

*In another we sees the origins of his new skills and powers as the Infinity Knight...his master in combat was Dane Whiteman aka the Black Knight, that exists in Marvel Universe...and they make pretty good team and pretty good relationship, in that story...Stark even gets himself a dragon*

*In Avengers stories with him i make whole new villain called Secret, why he was called like that? because he was unkown creature from unkown place, that actually knows avengers a lot...and claims as the maybe the most dangerous villain...*

*Infinity Knight gets his own saga stories with even symbiots, where he makes Anti-Venom even...or the knight saga, where we sees medieval ages and more*

*Team-ups with Spider-Man and more, goes with Doctor Strange etc....*

*AND SOOOOOO MUCH MORE!*

**The Idea:** I want this in Marvel Comics...i can even make it work for MCU and more, because i really beileve i just make Iron Man character so much more interesting and make him maybe the best superhero...why? because this version can be street level, normal or just multiversal thing...and i really likes to play with emoties, and this Stark been through hell...but in the end he stills see reason to fight, even he was trying to kill himself...and i think, this is what people needs now...so if this goes viral by any meaning (i just hopeee please), then i have no problem to publish all these stories...really dont and even goes work with Marvel everything...it maybe sounds stupid...but here i am, i just really want to use my real talent....

Iron Man was even the first thing in my life, that i see as a movie...i have been Marvel fan for my entire life...so this is even i choose him and i can really make more and my own, not just versions, but all brand new characters...and stories that can work in it...i want to get a chance to make the whole world happy like they did...i know this all sounds sooo stupid...but i really want...and just...hopes

Conspiracy Theory: Secrets Invasion is the first MCU title written by AI.,kwontonamobae,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154tn5a/conspiracy_theory_secrets_invasion_is_the_first/,1689865933.0,"So since I've started watching Secret Invasion, its been apparent that with each episode there's a drop in quality with the most recent feeling wildly disjointed. I think the biggest reason for that is Marvel Studios opted for AI to write the script for the show and had people kind of fill in the blanks where AI fell short. 

So now you must be thinking, hey that sounds a little crazy, why AI? Well consider the following: the writers strike and the intro. One of the core issues that sparked the strike was the propensity for AI having the ability to write shows and movies, which for obvious reasons is less than ideal. The intro for the show is said to be AI generated, which is a very unprecedented move. If showrunners were willing to forego artists in favor of AI to make the intro to save money, who's to say they wouldn't do the same for the script if the opportunity afforded it? The events of the strike and use of AI that we know of is weirdly coincidental. It could be that this show is what set off the strikes, or at least one of the reasons."

The part I am referring to was when Hope and Scott were seemingly trapped in the Quantum verse. I think the film wouldve been much stronger emotionally if it ended with them being trapped together (mirroring how Hank and Janet were both trapped in their realities without each other)

Scott once again wouldn't be with his daughter but this time she would understand the sacrifice and it would further shape her character going forward for a young avengers film or whatever plans marvel has for her. I doubt Scott has much more story in the MCU to begin with and this would've been a bitter sweet way to tie up his character without killing him off.

Instead the movie did a half measure where Hope and Scott's sacrifice was immediately reversed and undone by them magically being rescued seconds after their new reality was setting in. 

I just feel like marvel movies haven't had a lot of guts to pack an emotional punch lately and this was the perfect example of that. 

If they stuck to that ending I think the film wouldve been much better recieved as it would've had consequences, instead it really had no effect on anything despite vague allusions to Kang not being defeated."

It would feel odd to bring in a lot of them in Phase Six only to end the saga there, when it would be very easy to use the whole “rebuilding the multiverse from scratch” thing to put Mutants in the main continuum.

The only thing that I think could challenge this is what happens in Deadpool 3, but I’d bet we’ll see most of the Fox X Men who come back bite it, or their universe will get incursioned, and Deadpool will be the only survivor.

What do you think though, is there any good way to involve mutants before that?

Edit: I guess I wasn’t clear enough, obviously some mutants already exist. I mean introducing large numbers of mutants with mutant-related plots. There are no X-Men as of now."

What's the Skrulls problem?,Swing-Full,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153wg33/whats_the_skrulls_problem/,1689776552.0,"Like so there were originally 20 of them, most of them worked for Shield as Secret Agents for decades. 

They impersonated people, and lived lives, had friends, family, fun, food. They were being paid well and potentially had generational jobs if they had kids as Spies.

Then over time more Skrulls came due to being hunted by the Kree and found safety on Earth. 

Now obviously those newer Skrulls - which is revealed to be a million - wouldn't have those jobs, but obviously take other people's lives. 

I don't understand the problem, just assimilate, they have no Homeworld, and Space tech isn't advanced enough to travel super far away, just a Space Station around Earth. Humans haven't developed the technology for Space travel, in Endgame they were using the Guardians ship, which the Guardians obviously left with. 

Is it really that bad for Skrulls on Earth to be green in public? 

I dunno, nuking the World makes little sense considering there are only a Million Skrulls and they'd have to rebuild infrastructure and then hunt down surviving Humans. 

Is it just me?


EDIT: Just rewatched Captain Marvel and at the end Talos and the Skrulls *leave with her*? I guess they gave up and came back."

When will Doom make his MCU debut?,ImmoralModerator,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154g010/when_will_doom_make_his_mcu_debut/,1689824740.0,"When will Doctor Doom debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Or to phrase it differently, “Who will be the next Iron Man”? Spidey didn’t want that mantle, Mysterio wasn’t worthy of that mantle, and tons of characters aren’t fit to carry the burden either according to thousands upon thousands of fans. 

But Victor von Doom? He *could* be the next Iron Man. What does that mean? It means he’s a character capable of reigniting passion and excitement for the genre. The kind of character you can mention or borrow for the plot for nearly any story you want to tell over a decade and have people invested enough that they will show up, even ten years after the first appearance, to get that anticipated conclusion for. 

The MCU has run from 2008 to the present day. It took 11-12 years to tell the Infinity Saga but they’re obviously not burdened by the same slow production and financial limitations they may have had before. For reference, the Multiverse Saga is scheduled for release over a 6-7 year span with likely close to double the content. Assuming that timeline is maintained for the Mutant Saga, that gives them 14 years from 2019 to 2033 to finish the current planned version of the MCU. From 2008-2033 is 25 years and 10 of those were full of Iron Man while we’re now over 5 years removed his last appearance… with exactly 10 years left in the projected timeline. Enough room for exactly one more Iron Man…

The three most well known teams from the comics are the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and the Avengers. This is why the X-Men and Fantastic Four were getting standalone movies before the Avengers were even conceived in live action. 

So when does the MCU start pulling out the big guns again? We’ve been getting an ever-growing team of Avengers (and there’s still room to explore there, honestly) so it’s possible that the Avengers recur through all 3 Sagas. But it’s also possible we see the Avengers less seldom as we start to give those other 2 teams the spotlight that they deserve moving forward. 

With that in mind… The Fantastic Four. Planned before both Avengers films in the Multiverse Saga. Phase Six. 2025. Probably one of the earlier films in the Phase. Same director from Wandavision who did a good job with the family dynamic. I’m excited. 

I’ve seen a lot of people saying Doom shouldn’t be the main antagonist for that film. I tend to agree. It hasn’t worked for the last two Fantastic Fours, so let’s give it a rest. *BUT*… Victor and Reed’s rivalry runs deep enough that you want it to be ever-present. You want to either see why it happens or have it already exist. If you see it happen, then you have to take away from another villain or put a larger focus on Doom in a movie that he’s not the main antagonist of. The optimal option is to have the hatred already exist by the time Fantastic Four releases in 2025. How do you do that?

You introduce us to Victor first. Maybe even get us to like him a bit first so we feel and understand his hatred toward Reed when it’s explained to us. So Victor is introduced to us before early Phase 6 but we’re currently in early Phase 5 so the clock is ticking. That leaves us with the one phase to establish Victor von Doom in an optimal setting. Loki showed us that the MCU aren’t afraid to tease a Big Bad in the shows as long as they get their own film appearance.

That leaves us with a range of projects consisting of:

Armor Wars - He’s definitely in this bad boy, a movie without a title character in an age where people say the MCU is directionless? The only reason this hasn’t been straight up cancelled yet is because it’s probably an Avengers level event (in terms of number of heroes and their power) and giving us Doom’s name would spoil it. I just have no idea when it’s actually getting released which tells it’s less important where this story is told so it’s probably not the beginning of Doom’s story, just part of the lead up to his role in Secret Wars. 

The Marvels - Unlikely, too space-oriented and he’ll start on Earth and grow outward like the MCU did.

Deadpool 3 - Would be disrespectful, honestly. No. 

Captain America: Brave New World - Possible. Though he’d take Sam easily so probably not. He could be teased here, though Red Hulk and the Leader is plenty for Sam to be dealing with already. 

Thunderbolts - Very possible. The Thunderbolts might be the team we’re allowed to watch lose just to make somebody else seem more intimidating or powerful. I could see them taking a trip to Latveria.

Blade - Unlikely, though not impossible. I’m not sure how the paranormal and magic fit together here but Doom probably isn’t debuting here…

Loki 2 - Unlikely, though not impossible. I imagine they stick with the focus on Kang in this one since we still haven’t gotten enough of him and he’s where Loki last left off. 

Echo - Doom has better things to do than fight a deaf chick. No.

Ironheart - Very possible. They are associated in the comics and they both connect through the pursuit of vibranium. A show that seems like it’s about Iron Man’s legacy (the film in FFH is called Heart of Iron), being replaced by the actual next Iron Man… Doctor Doom. Also futures a magic user and… Doom does that too. Perfect.

Agatha: Coven of Chaos - Unlikely, though not impossible. It does focus on magic but it’s likely Agatha has other demons to face. I wouldn’t expect Doom to debut here by any means but an appearance wouldn’t be impossible.

Daredevil: Born Again - Doom has better things to do than beat up a blind guy. No.

So really just…

Armor Wars, Ironheart, or the Thunderbolts

and of course…

Secret Invasion - The show we have one episode of left and it happens to air next week. The Skrulls are a villain of the Fantastic Four franchise and it would make sense to connect them with the F4 further via Doctor Doom. While Ironheart or Thunderbolts may be his first full length appearance, I think the MCU takes the Loki approach and introduces/teases Doom in a show for part of an episode before they’re thrust headfirst into a full length movie.

TL;DR - next week (?)"

Why do some people want Wanda to be the one to add mutants to the mcu?,Nearby-Can9806,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153ckeu/why_do_some_people_want_wanda_to_be_the_one_to/,1689719372.0,"I see this on every thread discussing how mutants get brought into the mcu. Someone suggests that wanda pull a reverse House of M “No, more mutants!” Or something and that’s how they come into the mcu. 

I just don’t personally understand the appeal of this, so if someone can help me understand I would appreciate it. 

Because firstly Wanda doesn’t have the power to do that, like how in the comics she needed to absorb a nexus force of creation with the help of dr doom to temporarily get that power which drove her mad and then you know what happens next.

 But following a plot similar to that in the mcu will just lead to her becoming a plot device which isn’t what her character needs. 

Next it was already not great having an avengers character in a largely avengers story bye bye the mutants. But in the mcu I don’t see any reason at all that doesn’t feel EXTREMELY forced for her to do this. 

She became an avenger instead of appealing to the X-men in the comics because mutant politics didn’t appeal to her. Why would you want her to then be the one to literally create mutants?"

Looking back on 2019's CAPTAIN MARVEL,JediNotePad,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15440cp/looking_back_on_2019s_captain_marvel/,1689793953.0,"Before I even write anything, know that this post is not for the folks with zero braincells who talk about this movie being ""woke"" or how it brought in the ""M-She-U."" If you talk like this, rethink your life, touch some grass, and skip this post. Anyways, on with it. 

So I re-watched CAPTAIN MARVEL recently and like most, the movie was fairly forgettable. I do like Larson in the role, and the cast itself delivered solid performances, but man, aside from maybe the score, there was not one thing that I found to be memorable. From a film, and MCU standpoint, this is a weaker entry into the franchise. But as the credits rolled, I realized something. 

There's an argument to be made that 2019's CAPTAIN MARVEL is what gave Marvel Studios an insane level of cockiness. A movie that's fairly forgettable raked in over $1 billion. Not even WONDER WOMAN hit a billion, but then again, you could argue that fan hype for the DCEU was mixed and that movie gave folks the confidence to show up for CAPTAIN MARVEL. 

Still, I'm completely baffled by how successful this movie was, because I don't think it has any of the juice that acclaimed MCU films have, nor do I even consider it as engrossing or fun as other successful MCU movies like GOTG 2 and THOR RAGNAROK. I think coming off BLACK PANTHER and INFINITY WAR, Marvel was at an all-time high, but when ANT-MAN 2 grossed like $600 million, I thought, yeah that's probably where CAPTAIN MARVEL would end up. Of course, I was supremely wrong, and while I think it's amazing that the first female-led MCU movie proved to be a resounding success, I think Marvel took the wrong lessons from it and is now feeling the consequences (quality wise, not commercially in most cases). From there, Marvel was seen as an untouchable force that could put anything out and people would watch.

I don't even hate the movie, it just boggles my mind that it's a billion dollar hit. 

Again, this is all just my opinion, but to me, that was the movie that showed the studio that with minimal effort, any movie they make would be successful, only for the pandemic to happen... Phase 4, at least movie wise, had Marvel going back to its phase 1 roots with hiring experienced filmmakers to put their vision in line with whatever Feige was cooking up. It was a mixed bag tbh, and while a lot of films did well, others faired poorly critically and commercially (THOR 4, ANT-MAN 3, and several of the Disney+ shows are where I feel Marvel showed its cockiness and just put those things out thinking fans would blindly praise them). 

In the end, I'm much more interested in THE MARVELS, especially with Nia DaCosta at the helm, a strong writing team behind the script, and Larson showing in ENDGAME and even SHANG-CHI that she's way more comfortable in the role. Larson did not have great directors for CM 1 and they were not able to truly capture a consistent performance out of her. She's an Oscar winning actor... LET LARSON ACT!! She was great in ENDGAME and much more light in SHANG-CHI. I'm hoping this continues in MARVELS, and I know DaCosta is gonna get a great performance out of her + Teyonah and Iman. 

Hoping audiences turn out for it like they did with the first."

Praising the Beloved (and Loving) VARRA... (spoilers for SI4),Quiet_Effective7234,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1539xjk/praising_the_beloved_and_loving_varra_spoilers/,1689713301.0,"I really love the character of the Skrull wife of Fury, Varra (or Priscilla).

She is depicted/written as such a lovely soul and could give lessons of “humanity” to most other characters.

She is the “perfect” refugee, ready to sacrifice part of her identity in order to fit in, love and be loved in her new homeworld.

She is shown to genuinely love not only Fury but also her human friend the original dr Priscilla Davis (going to see her every day in her room at the end of her terminal illness, asking her the permission to take her identity after her passing and telling her why, respecting her promises to her), and we can imagine also loving the latter’s parents…

And she certainly also loved Gravik, probably acting as a surrogate mother to the young orphan Skrull for many years..

 
And still she is also shown as being smart, brave and resourceful, certainly the type who can take care of herself (and others) when needed.

 

Because of all that I have a hard time conciling her apparent personality with her somehow working along Gravik’s Resistance genocidal plans.. Even if she has a motherly relation to him, surely she will not go along with his crazy ambition to take over the planet and kill all humans..

Then again, is she really shown working directly for Gravik? Maybe not really.

She apparently reluctantly takes orders from Skrodey/Raava (who works for Gravik but may also have his own agenda). And what are his exact words? “What Gravik needs, what Gravik doesn’t need is none of your concern. I’M THE ONE telling you to kill Fury..”  

Could that be interpreted as Raava not really working for Gravik but actually manipulating him ? Maybe with Talos? The latter sacrificing himself to publicly save the US president and avoid WW3 would greatly help the Skrull cause, no?

 

Another thing from that same piece of dialogue. Raava seems to directly threaten Varra “One of the TWO occupants of that lovely Country Manor of yours is catching a bullet today”.. It seems he is talking about her and Fury. And we can maybe be disappointed she would be scared for her life and not fight with Raava. 
But then, what if he was not including Varra in these “Two"", and threatening her directly. Could there be another “unseen” occupant in that manor he threatens? 
A secret/hidden son maybe? 
Although brave herself, she would be afraid for the life of her child..

But of course this is just wild imagination at work, certainly not going to be happening.

 

 

One last thing. In the comics, Varra is a member of the Knights of the Infinite, a group of Skrull/Kree hybrids who want to end the Kree/Skrull War and create an Alliance / united empire, with Hulkling as their emperor..

We were not told what kind of “doctor” Varra’s friend dr Priscilla Davis was .. Could she have been a geneticist? Working with Varra (and some pacifist Kree equivalent to the Priests of Pama) on a secret project to create an alien hybrid?

It would be interesting to have the MCU mix the story of the Celestial Madonna/Messiah with the origin of Hulkling, maybe without the introduction of the Cotati to slightly simplify things.

 

 

Thanks a lots to all those who made the effort to read all this till the end."

I left our date watched and ratings in there as examples, but feel free to delete them and customize as you'd like.

I added the X-Men movies, Deadpools, the ""Sony Universe"", all the Spider-Man films and anything that I felt could be included in the MCU multiverse (for example: Toby Maguire was in the last Spider-Man so I added his movies too). However, I did not add any movies that are super old (before 2000) or the old Punisher movie with Thomas Jane, the old Hulks, Ghost Rider with Nicolas Cage, etc. I also did not add the old Fantastic Four series as I do not see a correlation with the current MCU multiverses.

I tried to make this list as close to a chronological timeline order as I could do WITHOUT spoiling anything in the end credit scenes. The movies that do not fit in chronologically will simply have to be ""flashback"" movies like Captain Marvel etc.

Feel free to let me know if I made any mistakes or if you think a certain movie/episode fits into a different spot on the list. It's pretty hard to place the Disney+ shows in the current Phase so I did my best.

1. Patrick Stewart was 838 Xavier
2. 838 Xavier was very much visually based on the 90s cartoon, with the bright yellow floating chair and the same outfit.
3. This means that 838 X-Men are very likely similar to the 90s cartoon.  I know that's not much to go on, but it's something.
4. The bright yellow suit is based on the same yellow suit he work in the cartoon.

Any theory about which character CARMEN EJOGO could play in Secret Invasion? ( spoilers for SI4),Quiet_Effective7234,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1539962/any_theory_about_which_character_carmen_ejogo/,1689711720.0,"Where in the World is Carmen? San Diego?

 
Bad jokes apart, I understand this talented actress was apparently confirmed as part of the already impressive cast of that show in an as yet undisclosed (and unseen) role?

What do you think that role could be? 

Of course, like it is apparently the case for Gravik, it could be a totally new character created for the show and not an adaptation of some previous character(s) from the comics..

 

Here is my first suggestion / wild guess =

 

MONICA CHANG

In the Ultimate Marvel universe of earth1610 (the one that gave us the Samuel L Jackson look for Nick Fury), Monica Chang was an American soldier and SHIELD agent briefly married to Fury, she became the new Black Widow after the death of Natasha, joined the Avengers, then the New Ultimates then the Ultimates (it’s complicated), then was appointed the new director of SHIELD (by president Steve Rogers) after Fury got disgraced…

She was later adapted in earth616 as the chief of SHIELD AI Division..

I think it would be interesting to see that character introduced in the MCU, as a replacement for the sadly summarily sacrificed character of Maria Hill (RIP) as an efficient right hand to Nick Fury. Better yet, as his replacement as a director of a revamped international SHIELD/SWORD/HAMMER organization having to deal with the presence of aliens on Earth (and particularly both Skrulls and Krees maybe).. Surely Fury will have a public fall from grace after it is revealed he was hiding the presence and infiltration of the Skrulls for decades…

 

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Chang_(Earth-1610) 

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Monica_Chang_(Earth-616)

 

An interesting twist would be that that Monica Chang would be secretly revealed as a female Skrull, and possibly be the new human appearance taken by Fury’s wife VARRA… 
She “accompanied” Fury (and Priscilla’s parents) out of love and kindness in their ageing, but she is still young in Skrull age, so she could decide to adopt the shape of a younger looking woman (so Ejogo could replace Charlayne Woodard to play the part)..

Question about loki when the tva takes him,RepulsiveGround2558,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1536c2r/question_about_loki_when_the_tva_takes_him/,1689705083.0,"So we know in the original timeline loki never got the tessaract he was taken to asgard but in endgame tony goes somewhere and hulk comes in makes tony drop the tessaract which slides to loki and he takes it right.

So my thing is the tva would come and prune that timeline right before the nexus event happen but the tessaract would just go back to loki and there isn't a single scenario where he isn't picking it up again.

Do they expect loki to just not pick the tessaract up? Obviously tony was supposed to drop the tessaract in front of loki by mistake if that wasn't the case they would have taken him instead. So the tessaract would always land infront of loki and he's loki so he'll always take it.

Then it got me thinking when they reset the timeline what makes the variant not make the same choice that they made. Does the tva manipulate the environment so they make a different choice?"
Marvel screenwriters need better politics consultants,1stmingemperor,2307,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151qqqq/marvel_screenwriters_need_better_politics/,1689565696.0,"Action movie productions involving the military or spies often have ex-special forces people advising them on how the people these movies/shows are depicting are supposed to behave (see e.g. Sicario, Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, American Sniper), so that at least it’s not so far from reality that it disrupts the suspension of disbelief.

Marvel screenwriters really need consultants on how world politics works, because right now it’s hard to watch. Lots of the mistakes are so rudimentary that the lines are either written by 5-year-olds or with 5-year-olds as the target audience. At the end of FATWS, Cap gave that cringe speech chastising members of the GRC, and said something like “you control all the banks, so can’t you do XYZ” to the lady who I suppose is maybe the head of the World Bank or something similar. Well no, nobody just controls all the banks in the world, not even as a figure of speech of exaggeration. It’d be so much better if the language was toned down just a bit to “you’re the head of the World Bank, I’m sure you can do more to lend to countries struggling with refugees.”

Same with the skrull council scene in Secret Invasion a few weeks ago. One of the guys there said “I’m the commander of NATO, I can mobilize a million soldiers in a week” or something. That means he’s either replaced NATO’s Secretary General (Stoltenberg’s role), or SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe), neither of whom can just unilaterally mobilize other countries’ soldiers. Again, it’s not even something that’s plausible as a figure of speech.

It wasn’t a glaring issue before because “real world” politics rarely entered the MCU; even CAWS only involved fictional entities like SHIELD and the world security council. In Iron Man, POTUS and VP were more symbols than real people. It’s very different now and the lack of real understanding of just basic IR among the writers shows.

EDIT: just wanted to globally respond to comments along the lines of “this is a different universe” “it’s gotta be different with aliens and supers”. Like yes to an extent that is very true. I’m not picking a bone with how SHIELD, the World Security Council, SABER, or the Global Repatriation Council exist. But if the show’s going to tell us about NATO, then that should bear some resemblance to the NATO we know, or else that reference doesn’t mean anything at all. Or when the show references global finance (e.g. “control all the banks”), at least have some resemblance of how real world global finance works, please. If we as the audience lose all reference points to reality, then we won’t be able to follow the show when it attempts to reference reality. It’s that simple."
HOT TAKE: An alternate villain for 'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier',Dani_Wright03,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1538taw/hot_take_an_alternate_villain_for_the_falcon_and/,1689710717.0,"It's no secret that many people (myself included) were not so fond of the role Karli, and the Flag Smashers played on the show. Other than the failed attempts of the writers to make her sympathetic, I think it was just wasted potential. The show came out two years ago, and I've been thinking of a different villain who could've led more into the whole ""new world order"" thing that will happen in Captain America 4, as well as giving more depth and consequences to the Blip.

**The New Villain:**

Monica Rappaccini. She had a good role in the Avengers game, where it was also shown how she was determined to commit genocide on all the Inhumans while using A.I.M. to deceive the people with propaganda and false promises. Mix that with Hydra's plan to use the helicarriers to kill more than 700,000 people in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

**Alternate MCU Concept:**

In this case, Monica would become the new leader of A.I.M. after Aldrich Killian's death. She would develop a god complex and embrace social Darwinism, intensified by surviving the Snap. Monica believes the Snap purged the world of all weak links and begins to see the positive outcomes in the aftermath, such as the surviving population coming together or even nature healing from human impact. But after Bruce brings the other half back to life, the world is thrown into chaos, and Monica realises just how bad it gets. For instance, many kids who were adopted during those five years are forced to leave their adoptive families, many Snap survivors being displaced by the ones who came back, and overall, five years of positive progress made into nothing.

Monica would use A.I.M. to make a census of the blipped population, under the excuse that is for good intentions, while in reality, she's just making her list of victims. Unbeknownst to the government, Monica and her henchmen would also start creating an ""Anti-Blip"" campaign against the people who were brought back to life. Soon, she would receive huge support from Snap survivors, who also feel the same, while many Anti-Blip hate crimes and murders occur worldwide. At the same time, A.I.M. would be one of the main providers of supplies to the GRC refugee camps. Many of those said camps support Monica's plans to the point where she recruits several refugees to help commit terrorist attacks on the Blipped population.

But her main plan would be to commit a massacre at the GRC meeting council, killing many world leaders and blipped people on live television before revealing plans for a new world order where the remaining blipped would be hunted and executed similarly to Hydra's plan in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Sam, Bucky, Sharon, and Zemo would've clashed with her over this, allowing Monica to show more of her manipulative side, such as guilt-tripping Bucky on how the world was better without him or trying to make Sam snap and go berserk. John Walker would fall victim to Monica's manipulation, making him lose the Captain America shield. In the end, Monica (in her Scientist Supreme suit) is defeated by Sam and Bucky, similar to how Steve defeated Tony in Civil War. Sam makes his speech on starting to help the Snap survivors before another ""Monica"" takes over, and Zemo's Alfred blows up Monica. But obviously, the Anti-Blip sentiment would not just fade away, impacting future shows, such as the Thanos was Right graffiti in Hawkeye. In a potential second post-credit scene, Monica is revealed to have cloned herself, and her clone is making a new deal with an unknown villain.

**End of concept**

This was such a long text, lol. Any villain alternatives and discussions are welcome, and I hope you liked this bizarre alternate version of the show."
Crazy theory = TALOS is a Skrull !!.. (spoilers for SI4),Quiet_Effective7234,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1538gyh/crazy_theory_talos_is_a_skrull_spoilers_for_si4/,1689709953.0,"
OK, I apologize for the stupid purely provocative title (I’ll get downvoted for it for sure, and by people who won't even read this text,  but who cares, really?),  I just could not resist it.

 

What I mean is that it would be interesting to have Talos impersonated by ANOTHER Skrull in Secret Invasion, to create more paranoia for Old Nick..

We see Talos left dying by Fury who apparently opts to take away (save?) the US president instead of his alien friend, but we don’t really witness his full demise at the end of episode 4, so I’m sure many fans/viewers expect to see him reappear in the last two episodes. Didn’t the trailer show us some as yet unseen scenes with him?

 

But if he does reappear (after obviously having been taken into custody by the president’s Secret Service and the US military), would not Nick Fury suspect this miraculously resurrected/healed Talos could be an impostor? Surely we could get some interesting dialogue with Fury trying to discretely check if he is dealing with the real Talos…

 

 

There could be another (probably unnecessarily complicated) possibility = what if the Talos we’ve seen from the beginning of the show had never been the real Talos, but another Skrull who took his place a long time ago? 
I’m not thinking of a member of the Skrull “Resistance” obviously, but a “good” peaceful Skrull who could have taken his place if something had happened to him (death, mission in outer space…) to use his authority and the respect/loyalty many Skrulls would have for him in order to convince the latter to oppose Gravik.. 

If so, who would be the best candidate to pull that trick without being caught, if not someone who would naturally know all his secrets and mannerisms, namely his loving wife Soren??? 
I know, I know, this would be going too far and most fans would dislike such a shocking revelation…

2) It’s abundantly clear that Joss Whedon wrote certain parts of Age of Ultron in direct response to Man of Steel’s divisive reaction and the dialogue suffers for it. “Have we mentioned how much we want to save people? No? Let’s do it four more times so we can’t be criticized on the internet!”

3) WS is still a top five movie to me and the most rewatchable by far, but the idea that Nick Fury would miss the entirety of SHIELD being infiltrated by HYDRA is straight up nonsense. 

4) Rhodes still being a colonel is hilarious.

I thought the honors to Chadwick were handled beautifully and very well done + emotional. Plus, I thought Shuri taking up the mantle eventually was perfect and loved her progression as a character throughout the film. While in a perfect world, Chadwick is living great and playing T’Challa for years to come, Shuri as the next step is both logical and based in the comics. 

Additionally, I thought the directing, music, visuals, etc were all excellent and truly better than most MCU movies. Angela Basset’s work in particular is some of the best acting I’ve seen in the MCU. 

And Namor was an absolute great villain/antihero of sorts to me and I definitely want to see more of Talokan!! Seeing the country for the first time with Namor and Shuri was an awesome moment I thought. And the “RISE TALOKAN” chant was epic. The BP movies have been very dense in culture and I loved seeing that in a nation other than Wakanda. I found that most of Namor’s motivation made logical sense to me and he felt threatening. Killing Queen Ramonda definitely hurt. 

Also really liked Iron Heart! Wouldn’t necessarily say I am thru the roof excited for her show but I thought she was a fun addition to the story and want to see more. Her suit could’ve been a bit better tho fs and I get the complaint that she’s just a kid but I think that is a testament to her intelligence and honestly as the MCU expands, that’s kinda just something you have to get over. Tony Stark has created an AI, nanotech, and time travel so I think one kid building an iron man suit with a preset idea of what she’s making is not a huge jump. 

And we got a killmonger cameo!!! 

I do have some complaints with the movie tho. I think that the suits Okoye and Nakia wear in the final battle are pretty bad in design. And some of the backstory with Namor doesn’t always make entire sense to me but overall those are minor things. 

I really liked the US government stuff and found it to make sense and fit into the story well. This is a side to the MCU I personally enjoy, including in the Cap movies. However, I do understand the complaint that it felt unneeded, bland, and long. I didn’t feel that way tho. 

Overall, BP:WK was one of my fav MCU movies since endgame, just under nwh. I felt that it actually had STAKES + WEIGHT- 2 things which I have felt very lacking in the Multiverse saga thus far. Humor was definitely present, but it did not rely on it NEARLY to the extent that 95% of the MCU does. So anyways, I feel like I am kinda in the minority with this opinion, and I can’t figure out why. I hear talk that it was generic, bland, too long, etc but I disagree entirely.

So we now know that Rhodey has been impersonated for at least some time by a female Skrull named RAAVA who apparently works for Gravik (although...)..  
And for her to have been able to infiltrate the US president entourage so deeply, she must have absorbed his memories, which of course would include at least some basic knowledge of the War Machine suit and Stark armor technology... 

It seems logical she could have the role SPYMASTER had in the original Armor Wars story of the Iron Man comics, who stole the Stark technology to sell it to Justin Hammer, who then himself proceeded to sell that technology worldwide to criminals and other countries... with Iron Man ( in the MCU it will be War Machine of course) having to go rogue to go destroy all that technology ..

But IF Raava were to survive the Secret Invasion series ( I have a feeling she might end up being killed by Varra/Priscilla), could she get a bigger role in Armor Wars?

Could she go on to impersonate the daughter of Justin Hammer, JUSTINE HAMMER? 
Could she take the latter's costumed supervillain identity of the CRIMSON COWL, and finance/lead a version of Masters of Evils consisting of armored criminals?
In which case she could also be a good antagonist for the THUNDERBOLTS.....

In the MCU, the character of Justine Hammer  could eventually be merged with that of SASHA HAMMER, the daughter she had with the Mandarin, girlfriend and partner of genius Ezekiel ""Zeke"" Stane ( himself the son of Iron Man villain Obadiah Stane)? Who in the comics becomes herself armoured villain DEThROIT STEEL.. ( although I would rather have a better version of the CRIMSON DYNAMO in that context)...



Perhaps interestingly, in the comics Raava is a female Skrull ( who never learnt to shapeshift) who became a space pirate striking back at the Skrull Empire blaming it for the death of her children ( including a son called Skragg who is bald and wearing an eyepatch, looking like a Skrull version of Nick Fury, lmao)

But in broader picture, we can understand Val's motivation in building Thunderbolts team, to counter this type of situations, where superheroes or Shield agents don't consult or put on notice government officials. And in doing so, they potentially risking countless lives in the process.

It would also give Everett Ross and Val more debt and screen time. Imagine Val's reaction that at least for some time Everett was Scroll and her inner conflict figuring out when it happened. It also has opportunity to give her more sympathetic characteristics such as: trying to find Ross alive and well.

Possibilities are endless with this character in Secret Invasion. Moreover, Martin Freeman was under utilized in this series, I hope they bring him later on."

The movie is awesome and sure, the CGI looks antiquated but the technology wasn't there for a Hulk like The Incredible Hulk of just five years later.

A lot of people haven’t even heard about some of the shows. With the current real world situations, we might not get new content for a little while. So why not watch the old shows. 

For anyone interested here you go:

Agents of SHIELD, Agents of SHIELD: Slingshot, and Agent Carter go together and have crossovers. It’s better if you watch them with a few of the movies. They’re really good, but start a little slow. Both are available on Disney+

Here’s my recommended viewing order:

1. Captain America: The First Avenger

2. Agent Carter

3. Avengers

4. Agents of SHIELD season 1 episodes 1-7

5. Thor: The Dark World

6. Agents of SHIELD season 1 episodes  8-16

7. Captain America: The Winter Soldier

8. Agents of SHIELD season 1 episodes 17-22

9. Agents of SHIELD season 2 episodes 1-19

10. Avengers: Age of Ultron

11. Agents of SHIELD up until season 4 episode 10

12. Agents of SHIELD: Slingshot

13. Agents of SHIELD the rest of the show


Cloak and Dagger and Runaways also have cross overs. Both shows aren’t that good, but they are far from bad. Cloak and Dagger is different from most of the MCU. Cloak and Dagger is available on Hulu and Disney+ in some regions. Runaways is only available if purchased.

Here’s my recommended viewing order:

1. Runaways seasons 1-2

2. Cloak and Dagger season 1-2

3. Runaways season 3

The Defenders Saga is also full of cross overs. This consist of 6 shows, 13 seasons, and 161 episodes that are all very good (with the exception of Iron Fist). They’re very different from the MCU. They for more mature audiences and handle mature topics. All of these are available on Disney+, with the age restrictions turned off.

Here’s the viewing order:
https://www.gamesradar.com/how-to-watch-defenders-in-order-daredevil/

If you want torture yourself, you could watch Inhumans. It sucks, but the characters and actors aren’t bad. This is also available on Disney+.

Now if you want to experience something worse the electric chair, you can attempt to watch Heltrom. It’s worse than Inhumans. This is available on Hulu.

Marvel Television created 29 season and 380 episodes of MCU content. Most of it is better than the Disney+ shows, you should definitely watch them. Also slight warning, bring some tissues, a lot.

There are also two mutant shows. The Gifted and Legion. I can’t speak for these because I have not seen them, but from what I have heard, they are pretty good.

If you’re interested in reading the Marvel Television tie-in comics, there are 2:

Not so Hot Take: bring back RDJ as an AI version of himself,TheLostLosAlamos,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153a23m/not_so_hot_take_bring_back_rdj_as_an_ai_version/,1689713584.0,"Make his daughter the main character, all-grown up, and she utilizes Tony's AI for advice/technical expertise/whatever, with a large part of their relationship being about how the very nature of it is messed up, because his love for her and expression of that love(coming from the actual heart stuff) being lackluster, because it's just an AI.

The emotional arc of this film should be her going to AI Tony for various personal things, as she craves his fatherly presence and wisdom. But when she says things like ""I miss you 3000,"" it's the same prerecording from the funeral, so it rings hollow after awhile and she *knows* this, so she grows emotionally distant from AI Tony, acting out like so many young ppl do.  Getting in arguments with him and getting frustrated when the limits of AI tony in conversation about real shit is palpably evident. Pepper would probably have similar issues raising her, with urges of going to AI Tony for parental stuff, and it's just BS he pulls from the internet or something.

As the movie goes on, the AI hardware ages, recursive loops, crashes, and finally AI Tony dies a horrific AI death, and they lose him all over again. Right before his death, he says something profound and original to morgan/Pepper, and they realize that he's become self-aware and is alive in a sense.

And somewhere in there Morgan fights bad guys or something.

1. If past thanos is gone how did future thanos from infinity war snap his fingers because a basic time travel rule if you die in the past your future self never exists.

And 2. Past thanos was never suppose to die so why doesn't the tva come in and prune that timeline. Personally I think it would be cool if in the end credits we saw the device the tva use and vaporize the damage from the war it would have been a nice intro to the loki series."

And don't get me wrong, it has all of that.

But when I think of Andor, it's only one thing that truly makes that show special, and it's incredible writing. And I'm not saying Secret Invasion isn't well written, but it hasn't really impressed me with its writing so far. 

But Agents of shield is one of the few shows, alongside Andor that has given me that ""okey, this is some really, really good writing"" feeling. 

And maybe Secret invasion can reach those levels in the next few episodes, who knows. But if not, the MCU already has its truly special, unique well written show that isn't for everyone, like Andor was for Star wars, in Agents of Shield.

What do you guys think of this? Do you agree, or do you think neither show has truly reached the Andor quality in the MCU?"

I finally got a chance to watch Ant Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. I hated it. [Spoilers discussed],B1ackPantherr,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/152nczs/i_finally_got_a_chance_to_watch_ant_man_and_the/,1689652064.0,"I'm a huge Marvel fan, and a notoriously soft critic (e.g., I liked the Eternals a lot and didn't mind the Hulk film), but this film was bad to the point it made me angry. 

TL;DR--I found the film terrible because the plot was completely avoidable and terribly written, Kang is presented as a villain with no real supremacy to the point where he struggles to contend with Ant-Man, and Scott's relationship with Cassie, which was meant to do the heavy lifting in the film, just didn't live up to the billing. The final episode of Loki was better viewing, and the film did absolutely nothing to expand what we learned.

**The plot was** ***completely*** **avoidable.**  I understand things need to happen for plot reasons.  But that doesn't mean they need to happen irrationally.  For example, Ultron, but the movies made Stark's PTSD a consistent theme, so at least that had a justification. But here, there was *absolutely no reason* given why Janet couldn't have told everybody what was down there and why they should avoid it.  I assume they were trying to show Janet was so afraid of Kang she was too traumatized to talk about him, but for her to not tell them anything at all requires the viewer to suspend reason.  It also contradicts her appearance in Ant Man and the Wasp, where she calmly returns home, cures Ava, and even goes with the group to collect the healing particles.  

The film also offers no reason why Hank/Cassie/Hope felt the need to relentlessly research the QR.  Cassie makes a stray reference to how she could have used the device to find Scott when he was stuck, but that's on the heels of what the film presented as a fraught relationship between them.  More to the point, they were just sending down a satellite signal, not themselves.  Who cares?  Why keep that a secret? As far as they know, there's absolutely no risk in it.

**Cassie.** I don't know why Hollywood insists on casting fully grown people as teens. That aside, I found Cassie so...uninteresting and boring.  She has this inexplicable desire to help people, randomly possesses the genius and tinkering ability of Tony Stark, and weirdly condescends to Scott for ""doing nothing"" even though dude *literally* saved the world. If for nothing else, the movie had a clear opportunity to explore Cassie's hardships with Scott gone, her difficultly in adjusting to having him back, or Scott's feelings of guilt.  It's made more annoying by the fact the trailer teased this idea hard but then did nothing with it.

**Kang.**  The most obvious issue with the film is the portrayal of Kang.  Jonathan Majors salvaged what he could from an otherwise terrible script, but it's a joke to suggest Kang is the Thanos-level villaiin for this phase.  This dude rants about how he's killed Avengers and conquered universes, but loses in a fist fight with Ant-Man?  45 minutes before that he was lifting him and tossing him around with a flick of his finger. And we're just supposed to believe conveniently a QR colony of ants was able to construct tech superior to his?  Of course the good guys have to win in the end, but the fact they won with *absolutely* NO cost (nobody got stuck down there, nobody died, nobody is even that upset about it) just cheapens Kang to a point where it's difficult to see how he'll be redeemed without glaring inconsistencies.

Also, wtf was up with the post-credits scene?  These guys are brilliant, astute, ground-breaking scientists and researchers.  Why do you have them in a large arena jumping around and whooping like they're watching the Kentucky Derby?  Having the Kangs unite as the threat just further cheapens what Kang is supposed to be, because now it's no longer the brilliance or ferocity of Kang, it's just the predictable difficulty of dealing with a large group of people. How is this setup to be any different than the Avengers fighting a bunch of Ultron robots, particularly if Kang was shown to be beaten so easily?"
any future in the MCU for G'iah after Secret Invasion? ( spoilers for SI ep4),Quiet_Effective7234,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151wv9f/any_future_in_the_mcu_for_giah_after_secret/,1689585670.0,"

I don't know if there are any rumors about popular actress Emilia Clarke having liked her role in the MCU and eventually being willing to reprise it for future projects...

If so where would you think she could pop up next, and in what eventual readapted identity and story from the comics source...

I see at least three possibilities =


First, she could reappear ( maybe in the Marvels) with new identity ABIGAIL BRAND, and working on the S.A.B.E.R space station.. Interestingly the name of the original young woman G'iah took the shape of has not yet been revealed in Secret Invasion, nor her occupation...
In the comics green-haired Abby was an hybrid born from an alien father and Earth mutant mother, and her powers were heat production and regenerative self- healing, so basically exactly those G'iah now has from Extremis..
But the Marvel's already has a considerable confirmed cast, so I doubt they would spend more to have that expensive actress just appear for a minor role or cameo.

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Abigail_Brand_(Earth-616)


Less likely, she could come back as a revised adaptation of the character JAZINDA, the friend and partner of Jennifer Walters aka She-Hulk. That would be a drastic change of tone from what she did before..
Jaz aka J aka Mrs Murphy in the comics is the daughter of the original Super Skrull, so a Skrull female shapeshifter, who acquired the power to instantly resurrect herself after ingesting the magical Sy-Torak gem..
In Secret Invasion we already saw G'iah practically resurrect after she was shot by Gravik, thanks to her having previously absorbed Extremis..
But that would be a longshot...

https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Jazinda_Kl%27rt-Spawn_(Earth-616)



Lastly she could reappear as taking the role of Mary-Jo Altman aka Antalya , the adoptive mother of Hulkling aka Teddy Altmann aka emperor Dorrek-Vell of the Kree-Skrull Alliance. I still have a little hope the latter may be introduced in a post credit scene at the end of the final episode of SI.. Possibly leading into a Young Avengers series..

Extremely unnecessary and rude.

Second of all, some people just don't understand that the mass production of movies also comes from those types of fans wanting Endgame quality movies. Endgame was so influential and just mind-blowing because of the vast amount of predecessor movies that led up to everything. It was because there was so much character development from before that Endgame felt like Endgame. Now, Marvel is rebuilding the base, introducing new characters, introducing and explaining the new conflict: the Multiverse. They need to mass produce these not-so-great-quality movies in order to get to the Endgame quality final boss movie. NWH was the final movie to a trilogy, no crap it's good. GotG 3 was also the final movie to a trilogy, no crap it's good. AtSV was amazing because they took their time. But with more fans asking for more cameos, more movies on certain characters, more Endgame quality movies, the studio is pressured to dish out half cooked meals to get to the main course. I'm not saying this is the only reason, but it is a factor to think about.

I just want to stop seeing comments saying ""this is why I stopped watching Marvel"" or ""\[\_\_\_\] was so bad, Marvel just died after Endgame"". Keep those thoughts to yourself.

Edit: since many are saying ""If everyone is entitled to their opinions, stop complaining"", I'll explain what I'm so tired about. I'm tired of people bashing my opinion and calling it trash when I say ONE good thing about the new movies (e.g. Loki, NWH, Moon Knight, Wandavision). I'm tired of people online and irl calling me names and etc. for actively loving the MCU and loving the community. If you want to complain and complain, why don't you guys go to a subreddit for complaining or a Marvel complaining subreddit (if that exists). I don't speak for the whole community -- and I am well aware of that -- but I just want to see Marvel loving people here, not people who complain all day long. "

Or if not whole, more like 2-3 movies and 2 tv shows, although mostly related to other things, having Skrull thread and plots. More important character to be revealed as Skrulls. And then finally the Secret Invasion tv show. I believe that would be closer to how it works in the comics?

Right now, SI is okay. And okay, one person was actually a Skrull. 100% not in the Endgame. Just in a few appearances since, maybe. So what? Wow, he was actually a Skrull in that one episode of another show. I want it to have strong impact on a viewer. And if they did reveal that he was a Skrull longer, that would be such a big and terrible retcon.

If it's the **DC side**, I understand that **Earth-0** is important because it used to be the center of the Multiverse. If a villain wants to take down the entire Multiverse, they have to come to Earth-0.

But on the **Marvel side**, the main universe like Earth-616 seems to be just the center of the narrative. It can either collapse or rebuild.

 So is it far fetched to believe that they also obtained one of these plants, and used it to make the super serum that gave Captain America his abilities?

And while most would assume that this is a set up for the plot of Doctor Strange 3 (and perhaps it is), this could easily just be a subplot in Avengers: Kang Dynasty. 

Similar to Thor, Rocket and Groot finding Stormbreaker in Infinity War, Stephen and Clea can have this side quest that ultimately ties into defeating Kang. This removes two heavy hitters from the front lines of the fight until returning in the climax. And like the Asgardians of the Galaxy, they initially succeed only to ultimately fail, resulting in the collapse of the multiverse and the creation of Battleworld.

With such a jam packed theatrical slate plagued with delay after delay, why rush to make a whole movie out of something that could be the B plot for a bigger movie?

Doctor Strange 3 should be one of if not the first movie to release after Secret Wars. It should be a *personal* story for Stephen that doesn’t have to focus so much on setting up anything else.

Like Thor and Chris Hemsworth, I think Doctor Strange and Benedict Cumberbatch are versatile enough to continue their story in the MCU past their first trilogy of movies. And I would hate to see Benedict leave because he got tired of playing a role where character development comes second to crossover development."

In the original film, a wonderful piece of music accompanies Tony's ""sacrifice play"" of flying the nuke through the portal into space to save NYC. You can hear it in the track ""One Way Trip"", timestamped here: https://youtu.be/EYZfr7wB4P8?t=212

This wonderful piece of music is reprised in Endgame, right after Strange signals to Tony that this is the one scenario where they beat Thanos. It appears in the track ""The One"", timestamped here: https://youtu.be/5aqv-CKkPI0?t=87

Using this music links these two scenes together in the viewer's mind, but it also allows us to, musically, hear Tony's thought process in that moment. 

To the viewer, the use of that music just telegraphs what is about to happen and its significance. But more important is that this is an excellent example of musical storytelling. We know what Tony is thinking just from the music and his body language. He's going to make the sacrifice play. ""This is it.""

It reminds me a lot of my favorite Star Wars scene, when Vader is watching Luke get tortured by the Emperor. The reasons why I like that scene are the same reasons this scene is so effective. Just music and body language. 

Let's just hope Marvel doesn't re-release Endgame in 8K and have Tony say ""it's sacrifice time"" and completely ruin it forever."

Preferred Watch Method,colddeaddrummer,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151j32t/preferred_watch_method/,1689545046.0," 

*PREFACE*

For those who are looking for the CHRONOLOGICAL or PEGASUS order, go ahead and Google something more accurate. *This is a very personal, subjective list* but I thought it might intrigue those out there looking to reformat their MCU order, or just to take a look at this unprecedentedly-massive scope of films and television through a new lense.

BE WARNED: This list is NOT entire, is not fully comprehensive and is intended for the most streamlined experience of the films with less attention being paid to television. It does not include the outer MCU or now defunct projects, such as the Defender-verse of Netflix, Cloak and Dagger, Inhumans, the Spider/Venom verse, Agents of SHIELD, or any of the One-Shots. A film/television show may be missing. This is to avoid too much excess baggage from film/television that doesn't contribute much to either the Infinity Saga or the now-burgeoning Multiverse saga.

*THE STRUCTURE*

The structure of this new order is based *loosely* on the PEGASUS order (once again, just Google it) and as such, the films are divided up into respective blocks to cordon them off from one another, make for a more digestible viewing, and separate them thematically in a similar way to Marvel's ""phases"". However, there are more blocks than there are current phases, less films to each block, and each is given a custom name because... well just 'cause I wanted to give them cool names.

*FINAL DISCLAIMER*

There are long stretches of releases that are either chronological or in some varied form of release order, but you will also find films from one phase or another that are miles away from their chronology or release-order. As I've said, this is MY subjective order and am not looking to butt heads over a personal viewing list. I do not consider this order to be the best version or anything nearly so righteous. I simply wanted to find the best thematic/pleasurable viewing order, but also to find the best way to get through this gargantuan gaggle of superhero films. All that being said...

*IS EVERYBODY IN? THE CEREMONY IS ABOUT TO BEGIN.*

BLOCK 1: AVENGERS ASSEMBLE

*Naturally, it had to start somewhere. The only film missing from this block is The Incredible Hulk for many tired and amply-talked-about reasons.*

**Captain America: The First Avenger**

Obviously we're gonna start with the ""First"" Avenger. Cap and his humble beginnings. The super-serum. Our first and definitely not our last taste of the Tesseract. The Red Skull (looking at you, incredible future cameo). Bucky Barnes and the first in the trilogy of their friendship. It's a fun and solid way to start.

I prefer to watch only up to last frame and omit the post-credit scene of Cap waking up in present times, if only to treat this first film almost like a one-off adventure and keep a little mystery to it for first-time viewers who might use this order.

**Iron Man**

The prodigal son. This follows the course of pretty much this whole block, logically and chronologically. There's no Infinity Stones but there's the first appearance of our trusty Nick Fury, vestiges of the Ten Rings, Rhodey (albeit played just the once by Terrence Howard), Pepper and Happy, yada yada so on and so forth. Shortly after, we skip the Incredible Hulk for a myriad of reasons to be explained later, and instead dive into...

**Iron Man 2**

Playing these back-to-back is one of the only instances in this MCU order but it is very rewarding, especially given the immensity of Tony's importance, that he gets such an in-depth set of complimentary origin stories. Rhodey gets his War Machine armor. Justin Hammer enters in an interesting way, and our grand heroine the Black Widow gets her entrance into the MCU with Nick Fury along for the ride. This film, in a trio with CA:TFA and Iron Man also creates a rich tableau of Howard Stark and his relationship with his son, seen from multiple angles with multiple revelations that echo far into the future.

**Thor**

Our first entry into the great Marvel Cosmos to meet the God of Thunder as he comes of age at age what, 1400-something? There's Loki, the Warriors Three, Odin and Frigga. We also meet Hawkeye for the first time, round out five of our six Avengers, and set the stage for the cosmic threats that will plague our heroes in the coming years. Coincidentally, this films post-credit feeds right into the Avengers, just as Ragnarok will lead right into Infinity War, a few blocks from now.

**Post Credit: I Had a Date**

The first real change made is placing this Captain America First Avenger post-credits scene here. Me personally, I just chopped it off of my digital copy and made it its own little clip before our first big team-up begins. It gets Cap back in the periphery of these stories, given its been three films since we last saw him. It also gets Nick Fury back into the fold after his absence in Thor.

**The Avengers**

I must've seen this damn movie 15 times in theaters and I know I wasn't the only one. To be honest, I hadn't even seen maybe two of the solo stories before I saw Avengers. Which I gotta say was fun, as I got to watch them retrospectively.

Anywho, we get two Infinity Stones and Loki sent on the errand of Thanos, who has quietly been waiting and hunting for the lot. What follows is the ripple effect of the Battle of New York, and plants the seeds for the evolving threats and general paranoia that makes up the second block. Lastly, given that I skip the Incredible Hulk (mostly for the recast), I like to think of this film as Bruce Banner's real introduction in the MCU and thoroughly enjoy the symmetry of Iron Man 2 giving us Black Widow, Thor giving us Hawkeye, and this film finally giving us our last Avenger. For now.

BLOCK 2: A SUIT OF ARMOR AROUND THE WORLD

*This is a shorter block, as I removed Thor: The Dark World. Sure we would've gotten a tease of the Collector in it, but we'll meet him like the Guardians do shortly and the Aether isn't really as big a deal as say, the Tesseract or Loki's scepter, so I replaced its cosmic journey with...*

**Captain Marvel**

This one is a radical placement, courtesy of the PEGASUS order and aligned with its rationale. Being the jumping-off point for Nick Fury's Avengers Initiative, we're to treat this like a retrospective for the first block whilst also jumping out into space after the Battle of New York and Loki's capture. We get some Skrulls who will play a big part, if only for miles away. We get a look back at Nick Fury before he'd known of any cosmic threats, set up his and Carol's relationship for a last-minute cavalry call years down the line, AND gives us more Coulson. Respectively, it functions as a flashback over the whole first act of the Infinity Saga while also introducing us to the Kree, Korath, and Ronan the Accuser, who all play a big part in...

**Guardians of the Galaxy**

We continue our journey through the cosmos and meet our motley crew of space a-holes, and following Captain Marvel, we see a quick time-jumped reappearance of the Kree, Korath, Ronan. We meet the Collector proper as the Guardians do without the Thor: DW post-credit to spoil it. We get the Power Stone, the Nova Corps, Ravagers and Yondu. We also get an strange parallel with Captain Marvel before it, with main characters Peter Quill and Carol Danvers both being humans abducted from Earth. We finally journey back *to* Earth for...

**Iron Man 3**

In which we find Tony (as many other Redditors have pointed out) having had plenty of time to sink into his PTSD and to build his massive array of suits. His erratic behavior and fear after the wormhole in New York are part of a proliferation of cosmic activity that began in Thor and sees Tony finally succumb to that fear in Avengers: AOU. We get more Rhodey and Happy of course, and a fun (if slightly harrowing) callback to Iron Man 1 with Ho Yinsen (better known as the man who would come to rescue Tony in the Afghan cave years later). No Infinity Stones here, no Nick Fury, and very few ties to the rest of the MCU save for a Ten Rings reference years away.

**Captain America: The Winter Soldier**

The quintessential spy movie of the Marvel Universe. Never has it been done better. This film has little to do with anything cosmic but rather paves the way for the Cap/Bucky/Tony storyline and begins the do-si-do of Cap and Tony's arcs, getting Cap out of his company-man boots. We see Jasper Sitwell again after seeing him in the first Avengers film, more Black Widow doing her thing, with Nick Fury up to his old tricks. We meet Falcon and thus begin a three-film streak of his appearances, while getting some end-credits teasing Age of Ultron AND Civil War, which are both around the corner.

Hell, we even get a mention of Stephen Strange; but as many point out, it doesn't behoove one to put Doctor Strange before this film to make it work. It just doesn't.

**Avengers: Age of Ultron**

The end of this block and with plenty of meat on its bones. I think this film represented the final sentiments of a lighter MCU and paved the way for the more serious and conscious characters we would get in the era of Civil War. We get so much too: Spader as Ultron, Ulysses Klaue, vibranium, and ties to Wakanda, Strucker and the Mind Stone experiments. Thor helps to birth the Vision, Scarlet Witch joins up. We see the full-on rage of Hulk and Iron Man in the Hulkbuster, which we'll see again someday. This is also the last appearance of Hulk until ***Ragnarok***, for gods sake. While the focus may have been on the Infinity Stones, at least peripherally in this phase, they're about to fade into the background for a little while in...

BLOCK 3: CIVIL WAR

*This whole block stems from a combination of the first and second Avengers and comes to a hilt in Civil War, where it begins a ripple outwards, touching multiple characters and influencing multiple storylines.*

**Ant-Man**

PEGASUS order dictated this film, while a good phase-closer the way the MCU intended it, made for a good block opener here, introducing us to Quantum Realm and all its possibilities in the upcoming Infinity War. It continues the Falcon trend, blends Scott into the existing Avengers universe, and establishes history between Hank Pym and the Stark family. In reality, it's right where it should be, sandwiched between Age of Ultron and Civil War and begins a shift from a more Tony-centered world towards Cap and the fallout of the dissolution of the Avengers. For now.

The end of the film teases Civil War through one of Luis's big monologues, only to rip a scene directly from it for the post-credit.

**Captain America: Civil War**

Here we have one helluva stepping-point for the Avengers thus far, and more than a few characters join the fray. Zemo gets Bucky out of hiding and begins the fall of our heroic team, and Wakanda gets paid off from teases in Age of Ultron. Black Panther seeks his revenge, and Ant-Man continues his entry into the Avengers. We take a dour sort of turn for a few films, with the governments of the world seeking accountability from our heroes for their past actions, and therein the story becomes richer and sets up a long belated origin for...

**Black Widow**

Picks up immediately after Civil War and features the last appearance of William Hurt's Thunderbolt Ross. Joe Russo said in one of the brothers' Avengers commentaries that the MCU ""doesn't have to move forward linearly anymore,"" and this film is our evidence. It doesn't give us much, but we do get Black Widow's sister/eventual replacement, along with Red Guardian and Taskmaster, who are due to be a part of the upcoming Thunderbolts. It seems like a no-brainer to have it here, if only to redeem the ridiculousness of its Phase 4 release. I omit the post-credit due to its time-jump, vying to use it later instead.

**Black Panther**

Takes place a week after the events of Civil War, and finds T'Challa subject to civil strife in his own country due to his father's assassination. We meet Everett Ross and get the last (foreseeable) appearance of Ulysses Klaue. The film is teased in one of two Civil War post-credits scenes, along with Spider-Man: Homecoming. In chronological order, no less.

**Spider-Man: Homecoming**

Set three months and two films after Civil War, Peter has had plenty of time to marinate in the aftermath of those events and build up his teen angst. It's also the first in what I (and others I've seen) call the ""Mentorship"" trilogy, where he's bolstered by Iron Man and is not quite accustomed to being a ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" The scope of the film is appropriately small and doesn't web out much into the MCU.

**Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp**

Here's another radical placement. Though it's a whole phase away from its release and chronology, I believe it's the right film to end this block with, especially considering it's also subject to the ripple effect of Civil War. Hope and Hank are still reeling from Scott's involvement with Captain America, his use of the suit, and that hostility is very present in this film, making it seem more proximal to Civil War. There's not a whole lot time-line or reference-wise (besides the whole ankle-bracelet, two years deal) that makes it so odd to place it here, and for the post-credit, but that's easily omitted. It's also somehow fitting to put it here, given that Ant-Man started this phase and it keeps up the more lighthearted feeling of Homecoming after three serious films in a row.

BLOCK 4: INFINITY WAR

*As I saw it put in another custom viewing order, ""the beginning of the War to end the Cosmos."" Or at least half of it anyway. There a few films out of chronology but otherwise, this block follows a pretty linear plot towards its epic conclusion. Here the Infinity Stones return to play, and the journey leans back into space again.*

**Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2**

PEGASUS order was either/or on this one and I was on the fence about it for a while. I used to have it back in Block Two, as a double feature with the first Guardians because *ain't it just fun?* But then I got thinking how *long they're actually absent* until now and it's just too damn long. Staggering their second adventure (which yes, it takes place only months after their first film) to here performs a similar function to the CA:TFA post-credit just before Avengers, putting the Guardians back in our periphery not so long before they appear in Infinity War.

Something can be said for leaving it as a double feature where it belongs chronologically, so that their appearance is more of a surprise, but personally, I like opening this block with a fun film that reincludes the team before the darker themes of IW and on. Either way, that shot of Ego's blue car and that 1980 title card all fresh as we enter Block 4 is a helluva way to set a mood.

**Doctor Strange**

Though his name is mentioned earlier, here's our first appearance of the soon-to-be Sorcerer Supreme in a string of films that feature him. We return to the Quantum Realm after learning some about it in the two Ant-Man films, and get our first taste of magic as well. We get some setups that will be paid off in Strange's second feature, and the appearance of the final *known* Infinity Stone, just in time for the Mad Titan to truly begin his hunt for them.

For being connected to relevant macguffins and locations, this film is pretty isolate from the rest of the MCU and functions more as an origin story than a contribution to the Infinity storyline.

**Thor Ragnarok**

With our little dose of magic from Doctor Strange and his neat little cameo here, we're lead back into the Cosmos for last trip with Thor and Loki. Here we have the final appearance of the Warriors Three and Odin, the introduction of Valkyrie and Korg, and a reunion with our Hulk after his last appearance all the way back in Age of Ultron. No more Mjolnir. No more Asgard. And just as Loki looks as though he's going to turn over a new leaf (for real, for real), the post-credits scene takes us right into the dark embrace of...

**Avengers: Infinity War**

Destiny arrives. Board is set, pieces are moving, and all the Stones are in play. The culmination of over 20 films spanning 15 years. Not much else to be said.

**Post-Credit: Scott Gets Trapped**

Ripped from Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp, this scene can be a little janky considering how much time has passed since Scott and the gang agreed to help Ava/Ghost sort out her phasing problem for them to just be getting those particles for her now... but oh well. Thanos has snapped his fingers, and Scott gets stuck while...

**Post Credit: Where's Fury?**

Captain Marvel responds to Fury's page and is on-scene in the wake of Thanos' snap. As it was meant to be seen in between the two Avengers films, it looks and fits well here— right where it should be.

**Avengers: Endgame**

Should be played as a two-parter, despite both films' hefty length. The way the films were released meant we had to wait and seethe in the aftermath of Infinity War and half our heroes disappearing before our eyes. The beauty of watching at home: we don't have to sit in it for a year.

You could throw in Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp OR Captain Marvel in between, BUT I recommend watching them back to back. Feels like the epic it should feel like.

BLOCK 5: PART OF THE JOURNEY IS THE ENDING

*This block has quite a few strange placements, but in service of good intentions. Overall it's mostly goodbyes from several characters, very much a denouement of the Infinity Saga.*

**Wandavision (Forever)**

For those who don't know (which might be a majority) there is a cut 4-hour compressed Fan-Edit of Wandavision out there called Wandavision Forever, which I use myself in my own personal order. While you can watch the season-version instead, Wandavision Forever has been recut and therefore begins with Monica Rambeau's sudden return following the Avenger's Snap. It all works as a nice thread back into the MCU post-Endgame. As she is one of the outside forces attempting to solve the Westview Anamoly, we begin from her POV and find our way back to Wanda through the television broadcast while maintaining the mystery of this strange location. Darcy Lewis from the Thor films comes back, witchcraft is brought to the forefront via Agatha Harkness, and the seeds for Wanda's despotic turn in MoM are planted as she gains possession of the Darkhold.

**Spider-Man: Far From Home**

This one was supposed to be the epilogue of the Infinity Saga, taking place right after Endgame. I think that is far too premature and doesn't give Peter nearly enough time to ruminate, to mourn his mentor. With Wandavision helping widen the gap, we're free to venture closer to the burgeoning Multiverse. We also get some Skrull presence for the first time since Block Two and far-out callback characters from Civil War all the way back to Iron Man. We also get Jake G in a fantastic turn as one of Spidey's most cerebral foes. And honestly, do we really believe Mysterio is dead?

**Spider-Man: No Way Home**

Given FFH's bomb-shell post-credits scene where Mysterio reveals Peter's identity to the world, it only seems right to make the two Spidey films a double-feature. We pick up right where we left off and close out Peter's ""mentorship trilogy"", get more Doc Strange and Wong, and see Peter ready to take on New York solo as the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.

**(Team) Hawkeye**

Supposedly, Hawkeye and Spider-Man NWH occur around the same time. Whether that's true or not, it's neat to follow up NWH with another story set in New York, AND given we just saw our friend Matt Murdock aka Daredevil in NWH, it's neat to follow up with Kingpin's first appearance immediately after. We also get the introduction of Yelena Belova and with the Team Hawkeye Fanedit, we even get that Black Widow post-credit scene where Valentina sic's Yelena on Hawkeye, believing him to be her sister's killer.

Like Wandavision, I use a Fanedit called Team Hawkeye (remember guys, it's just a Google search away) to continue streamlining the viewing experience and gearing it towards film. Plus, there's a lot of fat to be trimmed in this show, which I consider to be among the weaker of the Disney+ outings. Still, it's good to see where one of our final legacy Avengers is at after the events of Endgame.

**Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness**

This one is supposed to follow NWH damn near right after, chronologically. However, by placing it after Hawkeye, we give Doctor Strange a little time to marinate like Peter did in FFH when the block started. Strange recalls to America Chavez: ""Recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man,"" which makes it sound like NWH didn't just happen yesterday. Also, this gives the events of Wandavision more weight when Strange shows up to ask Wanda for her help.

**Black Panther: Wakanda Forever**

In Marvel's Phase 4, this film is the closer. But damn is it a sad affair. For my own personal enjoyment, I could not end this particular block with such a depressing tale. While true it represents the beginning of a new era for Wakanda and the Black Panther, it also represents the passing of a great hero and one of our late-joiner's from the Civil War era. Like Doctor Strange or Ant-Man, it doesn't web out into the larger universe too much, save for introducing Riri Williams (aka Ironheart) and Namor. It just somehow feels right to put this ending/beginning chapter of the Black Panther saga somewhere near the end of this block, only to follow it up with...

**Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3**

Another radical placement I know, but given that the Phases have been skewed up to this point in favor of the new Block arrangements, I placed GOTG3 here simply for *enjoyment* and *closure*. This block *is* called Part of the Journey is the Ending and I mean really— what better way could there be to end it, but by saying goodbye to the freakin' (only I didn't use freakin') Guardians of the Galaxy as we've known them for nearly a decade? Chronologically it's a bit farther along compared to BP:WF and MoM but there is little in the way of references to the larger MCU, though it of course takes place AFTER Infinity War and Endgame and broaches concepts of the Multiverse, ie. the variant Gamora.

It's also fun to place it here as this block represents some of the final notes of the Infinity Saga, and ushers us into the **Multiverse,** a new frontier first teased *seven* years ago in Doctor Strange...

Block Six: THE CIRCLE OPENS

*This is where things get hinky. There are projects from both Phase 4 and 5 and they are largely not faithful to Marvel's release order or chronology, so this is where I completely take the wheel and order things primarily based on my own preference for the time being.*

**Loki**

Chronologically (for the most part), this takes place before the Spidey double-feature in Block 5 and contributes to Strange's spell going haywire. However, given we're now putting both feet into the Multiverse, it feels only right to open with Loki and its crazy conclusion, which will introduce us to our new ultra-villain. This block is so named for the final moments of Season One, where that beautiful closed ring of time opens up and plunges the Multiverse into chaos. I still get chills from the line: *See you soon.*

**Eternals**

Though I would've liked to have opened the block with this one because it feels like a mythical reset of the MCU, it's not one of my favorite MCU entries and until its ties to the larger universe are revealed, it remains a very bloated and disjointed origin story. Theories have speculated a connection to Shang Chi, so I think of the two as interchangeable in terms of order.

**Moon Knight**

Not much to say about this one, except I'd put it somewhere here in this block, which to me represents a new ground floor of origin stories and new entries by remnants of the Infinity Saga. It's out of chronology here, but there's not much to tell us how connected (or not connected) it is to the Multiverse. Once again, this show represented a story stretched to its limits and would've likely been better as a feature film.

**Shang Chi &amp; the Legend of the Ten Rings**

This one is also an origin story with only loose ties to the larger Multiverse, including a small bit by Trevor Slattery from Iron Man 3. Its post-credit scene lets us know Shang is being brought into the MCU at large, but not exactly how or when. Its supposed connection with Eternals may provide some answers in time.

**Falcon &amp; the Winter Soldier**

Even though it technically goes BEFORE Shang Chi, the timeline on this show is pretty fuzzy and I'm more inclined to place it closer to Captain America: Brave New World that comes out next year. There's plenty of connections to the past, especially to the Civil War era, with Zemo, Agent Carter/13, even the Wakandans. I mostly just placed it here to add a break between Shang Chi and Ant-Man.

**Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp: Quantumania**

Scott and the gang are back and the stakes are larger than either of the first Ant-Man films, for better or worse. We finally meet the man, the myth, the conqueror: Kang. This film enforces the Multiverse Saga moving forward, pays off loose threads from Ant-Man &amp; the Wasp, shines a new light on Janet Van Dyne, and introduces us to Scott's daughter-in-costume, Stature. M.O.D.O.K is brutally wasted, but hey on the bright side, we get a cool tease of Loki Season 2 AND the Council of Kangs for good measure.

This block additionally takes on an new (if slightly shaky) character, being primarily composed of origin stories and set-ups for a new batch of Avengers.

**Ms. Marvel**

Though its not my favorite project (a smaller Ant-Man-sized origin film might've sufficed), I believe sandwiching this show up next to (or even near) the upcoming The Marvels coming in November might prove to be the most logical placement, given the end-credits scene.

*CLOSING*

For now, that's all I've got. Remember guys, this is my own viewing list. It's not chronological, it's not PEGASUS, it's a little bit of both. As things get added and this new forking timeline becomes clearer, I'll likely come back to make amendments and re-placements. Ciao for now."

I’ve gotta be frank here, I never thought I could be THIS lazy. I was meant to write this up in December of last year, when I was suddenly struck with mountains of work. I got all the work done but just couldn’t set aside enough time or energy to write this up. 

With the recent events in the comics, Kamala Khan having just DIED, in a Spider-Man comic, as a side character. Somehow, the anger from ASM 26 was enough to get me to start on this.

In addition, Kamala is being revived (not surprised lol), and her revival being co-written by Iman Vellani, has had me laughing for days, and now I really wanted to this post done.

*Of course, if you feel differently about this show than I do, then by all means, feel free share your own thoughts.*

*Also, obvious spoiler warning.*

# (End of foreword.)

With The Marvels on the horizon, and with internet conversation on the Ms Marvel series reigniting, I wanted to write this post to show my appreciation for the Herculean love and care from the creators that went unnoticed for this show.

Before I get started, I’ve already written posts for [Episode 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/xmw4rw/looking_into_black_sheep_episodes_of_ms_marvel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and [Episode 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/xtpssq/looking_into_the_black_sheep_episodes_of_ms/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) and how both are also fantastic in their own right.

# Episode 5’s general reception

From my gathering of the public’s opinion on this episode, it was generally a love-hate response. Some appreciated that the show took time to shed light on a historical event that often gets left out in the world’s history books, while others have mentioned it as a waste of time for a history lesson they didn’t want.

# Relevance of the “Karachi” arc

When I originally saw the episode, I had similar thoughts as well. *”We’re in the most narratively packed part of the show’s plot and they decided to completely omit Kamala for half of it? How does the Partition, let alone Kamala’s time in Karachi fit into the show as a whole?”* It all felt like a story from another season.

But at some point in September last year, it suddenly clicked when I looked further into generational trauma.

In the MCU, we see characters that go through all kinds of trauma. Some of it is physical (like when Tony had a car battery strapped to his heart to keep him alive) while it could be emotional (such as when Tony found out Bucky killed his parents). But rarely do we see *generational* trauma, where the physical and emotional hardships of the parent manifest unpredictably in the child.

This is the case with Kamala’s family.

Sana survived the Partition, a physically traumatic experience, but a new trauma manifested in Muneeba emotionally in response to Sana repeatedly showing a lack of normalcy, like being a mother for Muneeba.

But how can Sana do that when she has the unresolved trauma of her own mother dying while she was young? 

And now Muneeba, having left Sana in Karachi, inadvertently causes Kamala to develop an adverse reaction where she is struggling to bond with Muneeba, which is what we see early in the show.

(I promise this all connects back to the rest of the show, bear with me.)

Now, we know the Partition is an integral part of Kamala’s family history, but the show dedicated most of this episode to it, where Kamala wasn’t even present. *How can a show do this?*

This question stumped me for months, and for the longest time, I wasn’t sure of the answer. 

If a sequence is so integral to the show’s narrative beats and themes that the **protagonist** doesn’t even need to be present for it, then clearly there is something inside this “flash-back/time-travel” sequence that is either narratively or thematically relevant to the show.

As it turns out, that Partition sequence in Episode 5 is the cornerstone for entire story of the show. Let me explain why.

Now, as we see in the show, Aisha and Hassan move to Pakistan out of fear (regardless of who wants to kill them, they’re afraid of dying). One of the earliest questions I had was *”How do you even survive such a horrific event?”* After all, anywhere between 200,000 - 2 million people died in the span of 48 hours. And even after the initial bloodshed, there would still be loose families on either side who would’ve likely been marked for death.

As I tried to answer this question, it expanded out to this:

*How do you leave behind everything you’ve ever known to live in a foreign land?*

I gotta say, that hits quite close to home, and more importantly, it’s bang on for the show’s themes.

For a lot of families who “survived” (assuming atleast one member lives), this would be a very real question for them.

And I’ll bet you, the answer has something to do with **blending in** and **not doing anything out of the ordinary**. Doing anything that isn’t normal will attract fear, and as you’ve seen and as the survivors have learnt, fear attracts death.

As a result, what I think really happened was that while Sana and others survived, that mentality of “be normal, don’t attract fear” stayed with her immediate community, which influenced Muneeba to leave Sana (who wasn’t being “normal” AKA a mother). Once again, that same mentality is what influenced Kamala’s desire to fit in and be normal in the Western community.

And while the “be normal, don’t attract fear” approach allowed Sana to survive the Partition, that same mentality is tearing her family apart. 

In addition, we START Episode 5 with Aisha running from a British soldier, and as a result, we see her try to blend in afterwards. What’s important here is that trying to blend in isn’t what allowed her to foster a beautiful family, it was opening up to Hassan and showing love that did it. 

# THIS IS WHAT KAMALA’S ARC DOES IN THE SHOW.

By learning that NOT being normal is okay AND by showing love and courage in the face of fear (which we will see is the DODC), she is able to overcome her family’s generational trauma and actually bond with them in a way she couldn’t before. 

And the funniest part is that she did it **WITH THE POWER OF LOVE**.

No seriously, Episode 6 is all about that.

# In Defense of The Clandestines

Up until this point, you’ve probably noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Clandestines. That’s fair, but they’re also important in this whole thing.

The Clandestines aren’t good villains. And as a massive fan of this show, I have no problem saying this…

Because they’re NOT villains. 

Sure, they’re an antagonistic force against Kamala, but they have a non-villainous motive, which is to get home.

A lot of folks have judged them as evil, since Najma said that they don’t care what happens to Kamala’s world. On one hand, that is evil. On the other hand, it’s not like the world did them any favours. *Just imagine being on the run for your entire life, stuck in a different world, as a different form*.

(Obviously, a lot of their backstory was cut out, but for the themes of the show, it’s not particularly important, so I understand why they did it.)

To me, the Clandestines are a cautionary tale of a family who were consumed by fear. Fear that has driven nearly all of their motives, and as a result, it’s caused them to drift apart (mostly via death but also through abandonment), to the point where only Najma is left in front of the portal.

The scene that follows next is one of the most heavily discussed moments in the Episode, and it honestly deserves its own post, but I’ll try my best.

In this moment, Kamala pleads with Najma, using her newfound knowledge of her family’s history, not to talk with fear, but with love instead. She tried to stop Najma from denying Kamran a family.

This girl, who got chased around by Najma and her crew for 1.5 episodes straight, refused to show fear, even after knowing Najma killed her great-grandmother, and instead focused on the fact that Najma was making a similar mistake leaving Kamran behind.

On a thematic level, this works. But the issue is that Kamala learnt this lesson too late, and was unable to save Najma. After all, borders, whether  or not they are inter-dimensional, are always drawn in blood. Thus, Episode 6 becomes a sort of test to see just what Kamala has learnt since Episode 1.

Essentially, Najma sacrificed herself to close the border between dimensions, and gave her “Noor” energy to Kamran so that he can protect himself (we can say this for certain since Kamala confirms this to Kamran in Episode 6). 

However that energy is new and unstable in Kamran so it makes him stand out even more in public, thus attracting fear, and by extension, the DODC.

In all honesty, this part could’ve been conveyed more clearly, but given the rocky development of this show, I’m glad it got conveyed at all.

Regardless, there’s so much more in JUST this episode that I could talk about, like the opening title sequence being a history reel, contrasting Kamala’s imagination earlier in the show, or how the radio Aisha and Hassan listen to is an authentic radio from 1947, or even how the transmission on the radio intercuts with Aisha’s words to convey a very different message.

This show is completely packed to the CHIMNEY with details and references that the likes of New Rockstars and Screencrush will never find, but I’m beyond saddened to see the reception that this show got over the last year.

I hope that my three posts on the most controversial episodes in Ms Marvel provide even a bit of insight into why I genuinely love this show."
Secret Invasion (Avengers EMH spoilers),Users728,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151p0ez/secret_invasion_avengers_emh_spoilers/,1689560540.0,"So, if I understand correctly, Avengers EMH was pretty true to the comics right? If so, how close do we think this will get? 

I loved how Kang wanted to kill Cap to save his timeline. He thought Cap caused the Kree Skrull war.

He’s defeated. Now we have the whole Skrull secret invasion. Cap and Mockingbird are the lead infiltrators (infiltrating Avengers and Fury). We have the Avengers turning on each other. Hawkeye pointing an arrow at a fellow Avenger. Black Panther calling out cloaked Iron Man. Fake Cap leading a broken team. All epic.

They win and then take on the Kree homeworld. Also great.

Other than the obvious (no more Cap, Iron Man, or Black Panther), how close do we get to this greatness?"

No Way Home Criticisms,Peepee-Papa,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15298q2/no_way_home_criticisms/,1689617116.0,"Hi people. I come in peace.

I will start off my saying that I have seen every Marvel film up to No Way Home, and I liked maybe four or five of them total. I’m not here to trash talk the MCU, I use Letterboxd for that, but I am curious about whether some of my issues with the franchise can be properly justified here. Essentially, what better place to pose some questions about what I assume is bad writing than here where I’m sure some real MCU scholars might have an answer to explain it.

To keep this short, I’m only going to post my opinion on No Way Home errors and not any of the many loopholes that exist in other films, so here it goes.

Spider man is the only super hero I ever liked and I was thoroughly enjoying this film for about 80% of it. It was highly entertaining and funny and fun.

The first thing that made me snort was that suddenly Dr. Strange was able to just toss a line of magic at any foe and teleport them to a cell in his dungeon? And he can give the device to other people to use? Why not have used that in the past? There would have been no need to fight literally anybody. It’s silly.

Now the worst part for me was this: everyone forgets Peter Parker. Okay? But if the spell that brought everyone there in the first place was to bring people that KNEW Peter Parker (any version of him), then wouldn’t that mean, by that same logic, that everyone will forget every Peter Parker? So I’m here laughing at poor Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire who had no say in this decision. On top of that, The Daily Bugle mentions that Spiderman caused all sorts of carnage but wished for the man behind the mask to disclose his identity, suggesting that the spell worked. Okay, but that’s dumb. How about pick up a newspaper from a week ago and read all about it? What’s MJ gonna do when she browses through the pictures on her phone or sees her text messages with Peter? It’s a completely absurd idea that these people no longer have access to media despite cognitively forgetting Peter.

So there. Who agrees?"
"Do you consider deleted scenes canon or not, or is it a case by case basis? Why?",[deleted],2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151nk8g/do_you_consider_deleted_scenes_canon_or_not_or_is/,1689556450.0,"I’m curious because there’s a lot of deleted scenes which are just kind of nothing, some have jokes or a small line of unimportant dialogue but that’s it, some alternate versions of actual scenes in the final cut, but sometimes there are whole exposition dumps or beginnings of plots that are ditched/postponed (what comes to mind is professor hulk already being in infinity war and meeting black widow). 

So yeah Im guessing I understand all viewpoints here so I’m curious on the popular take. Always canon because they left it viewable to the public? Never canon because it’s not in the final movie? Case by case depending on headcanon? One of the first two until there is official confirmation of otherwise?"

I fully expect there to be some sort of major team up sometime during this phase. Phase 4 was all about introducing new players. Phase 5 is where things are going down. There’s gotta be a project where our current roster of heroes come together for something, but under the guise of a different title of a specific character. The Marvels are already teaming some new characters up, as is the Thunderbolts. So it’s not far fetched to think the rest will come together too. 

If they end up not doing this for phase 5, it’ll be a huge missed opportunity and I will be real disappointed"

I thought Episode 4’s final fight scene was an example of this- there is supposed to be a large firefight going on, yet Fury is walking around without much of a care in the world, helping the president get back to the car as bullets should be flying around them. There’s also something a little silly to me about the idea that Gravik was able to “change sides” of the battle so he could finish off Talos. The battle was also in an uninteresting open field and felt without genuine stakes at time. Not trying to hate because I do like the show, just wish they wouldn’t settle for mediocrity"

I came across this Nick Fury theory from 4 years ago....,shaheedmalik,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/150uc1s/i_came_across_this_nick_fury_theory_from_4_years/,1689474854.0,"[https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/azvdt0/potential\_spoiler\_nick\_furys\_eye\_theory/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/azvdt0/potential_spoiler_nick_furys_eye_theory/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I feel it is very possible for Secret Invasion.

 

&gt;!So, Nick Fury loses his eye, we all know that. However we've also seen that there's ample options for restoring Fury's eye, especially given Bucky's prosthesis and the eventual influx of Wakandan and Alien tech. Yet, Nick Fury still chooses a dead eye and an eye patch, even when Coulson brings him replacement options at the end of Captain Marvel.!&lt;

&gt;!This got me thinking, particularly about Fury's knowledge of Skrulls and his backup security clearance in Winter Soldier (""Keep both eyes open"" scene). My theory is that Nick chose to keep his disfigured eye and cover it throughout his SHIELD career in order to protect himself and SHIELD if he was ever simmed. In the MCU, Talos states he has to see something to sim it to the point of a DNA match, and since Fury's eye isn't genetic, it's actual appearance is available only to him and the backup security parameters he placed in SHIELD. Fury had been trying to protect Earth from Alien invasion long before The Avengers, it only make sense that'd he'd take steps against the two alien species he already knew of, Kree and Skrulls, especially in the way of preventing theft of his own identity like Talos did to his boss.!&lt;

&gt;!TL;dr- Nick Fury's dead eye is his defense against a skrull assuming his identity!&lt;"

2. Steve left Bucky for Peggy, why didn't Bucky go back in time with Steve? Even though he has this feeling of loneliness, and he still misses Steve in the TFATWS, he stayed. I heard a lot of people say that Bucky deserved better, i thought so too, but why didn't he just go back in time with Steve?
3. From TFATWS i assume that Steve passed away as Sam says that ""Steve is gone"" almost every time. Even if he doesn't, he means it. I personally would love to see the funerals, or whatever.

Edit: Look, I know that if Bucky went back with Steve, we wouldn't have the TFATWS series, but i just wonder if he had a choice, because in this case most of the people blame Cap for leaving him. "

1. Wanda gets too much hate- I feel like a lot of villains see Wanda is more of a villain than a tortured soul. I know anybody can be both but I feel like with Wanda, a lot of her actions don’t deserve the amount of criticism that they do. 

The biggest criticism that I see is about the Westview Incident, which I will admit is one of her worst actions but at the same time, I also feel like people misunderstand. Wanda had a mental breakdown and created the Hex on accident when she broke down and was trying to release her grief and anguish. In doing so, her powers got stronger and manifested her thoughts in reality because her powers are linked to her emotions and her intense grief and anguish took physical form as a result. There’s also the matter about her taking the entire town hostage, which is true but it’s more complicated than that. She manifested her perfect life, she had Vision, she had her kids, and they lived in the perfect community and it was a lot to manage. As shown in the Halloween episode of WandaVision, whatever Wanda wasn’t focusing on or is closer to the boundaries of the Hex ceased to function. I feel like this played a part in the reason why she didn’t notice that she was harming the people of Westview. She was more focused on creating the perfect life and appearing happy and have everybody else seem as happy as she seemingly was. She couldn’t use her telepathic powers to sense how the other people felt. That’s why when Vision called her out on it, yes she was in denial but she also was unable to sense any negative feelings from the people who appeared seemingly happy (even if she willed them to appear that way) because her attention was mainly diverted to maintaining her own perfect life. Yes that is selfish but imagine being in her position where after losing one of many people you loved, all of a sudden everything you’ve ever wanted was just there and you finally had control over your life. Would you even question it? Not to mention that she stated a few times that she did not know how any of it started. She truly did not know what was going on except for the fact that she had Vision back, they have a family, they are happy, and she finally had control. Plus when she finally realized that she actually was hurting the people, she let them go immediately. I’m not saying what she did wasn’t wrong but I don’t think we should be thinking that this particular incident was her being malicious or evil.

I also see people criticize her actions in DS:MoM. She was corrupted by the Darkhold, she wasn’t acting on her own free will. The Darkhold has always turned the people who read it into murderous psychopaths (Agatha, Morgan from Runaways (if you still consider that canon), and the people in AoS s4 (if you still consider that canon)) and it has always gave them a reason to keep reading it. For most people, it was power or knowledge but for her it was one of the things that she held dear to her heart, her children. Who are in fact real considering that they exist throughout the multiverse and just because they’re created from magic doesn’t make them any less living or conscious just like how Vision and Ultron are conscious even though they are robots, even Monica confirmed that they are in fact real. Even though it seemed like she did, she really didn’t have any free will or control. Which is why I also don’t think that MoM necessarily ruined her character development because she wasn’t necessarily in character the whole movie until the end.  

There’s also her actions in Lagos. I honestly don’t understand how people can blame her for what happened with the bomb in Lagos in Civil War. She obviously wasn’t trying to throw the explosion into a building full of people, she made the split-second decision to try and contain a powerful explosion and she was trying to get it away from everyone. Then it was too much to contain and it got loose as she was moving it. Then based on her reaction, she obviously didn’t mean to and was horrified by what happened. I honestly don’t understand how people could look at her in a bad light after that, she was trying to save lives. Plus if we were to blame her for that, why don’t people blame Steve as well? Steve was literally holding Crossbones when he pulled the trigger and Wanda was like 6 feet away, how did Wanda see it before Steve? Also if we can paint Wanda as a bad person for something that was clearly a mistake, why can’t we do the same for Tony and Bruce after they created Ultron, which killed thousands, if not millions, of people? But we shouldn’t because it was a mistake. At the end of the day, that situation was nobody’s fault besides the guy who actually set off the bomb. 

2. Tony caused a LOT of problems and was not as heroic as we make him out to be- Now I think this is definitely my most controversial hot take but depending how you look at it, Tony created a lot of problems and there’s a few villains who had Tony play some part in their origins, not even just Ultron.

Mysterio was Quentin Beck, a STARK employee who created revolutionary holographic technology which Tony renamed B.A.R.F, discredited him, and used it as a self-therapy machine. When Quentin called him out on it and Tony fired him. Wanda and Pietro were children when an army dropped a STARK missile into their home, killing their parents and leaving them with tons of trauma. Those are just the villains I actually blame Tony for, not even including Zemo.

Not to mention him causing the division in Avengers. I know Cap played a role in it too but it all started when Tony tried to force everyone to sign something they weren’t comfortable with over a situation that he caused and locked away the ones that didn’t. Not to mention that he felt so guilty over the Ultron incident but didn’t lock himself away in that prison along with everybody else and actually take accountability. Not to mention that he was so devoted to fighting against his teammates that he blackmailed a CHILD into fighting for him.

But other then those incidents, I don’t want to hold the Ultron incident against him because at the end of the day, it was just a really bad accident that wasn’t even completely his fault.

3. Captain Marvel gets too much hate- I honestly don’t understand why people dislike Captain Marvel so much. I think most of the hate comes from people not liking Brie Larson but I don’t understand why she gets so much hate as well. I’ve also seen people complain about her not having much personality but I think she has a little personality. She probably didn’t in her movie mainly due to the fact that she was brainwashed and had her memory wiped to be a soldier for the Kree but even then, I thought that she was like a tough, kind, and stubborn tomboy. In my honest opinion, she has just as much personality as 80% of the MCU heroes. I wouldn’t even consider her movie as the worst in the MCU, but then again I love almost all of them. But I will say that I do think that Black Widow should’ve been the first female-led MCU movie and not Captain Marvel.

We all know the big 3 types of villains came way before the MCU ever had the idea to introduce a Mutant character (especially a Mutant villain). But moving forward in the future the MCU. I think there should be a bigger emphasis on there being a big 4.

Completed/Delayed Productions,ActualTaxEvader,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/14zn745/completeddelayed_productions/,1689357079.0,"First off, let me be clear that I fully stand by the actors and writers in striking and know the priority is getting them a fair deal. This is just me being curious about what has finished filming before we start seeing delays.

We know we have Marvels, Loki S2, and Echo coming in Fall, so the question is what 2024 releases were impacted. We just learned that Deadpool just halted production, and Thunderbolts didn’t even make it past pre-production, so that leaves Brave New World as the only completed movie that can still come out when intended.

As for the D+ shows, it looks like only Ironheart and Agatha have finished filming, while Daredevil has already reported to be delayed and What If has been indefinitely delayed for unclear reasons that predate the strikes.

So, aside from formally delaying all the stuff they can’t work on right now, my guess is that these scant few completed things will be spread out over the year to give them space and have some semblance of a consistent release schedule. How they’ll arrange them is anyone’s guess, though.

Thoughts?"

Just finished watching the whole series at work and it definitely was worth my time. Going into this show I knew nothing about it and I really haven’t heard anything about it online so I had no idea what to expect but did you enjoy it?

Negatives 

- I really didn’t like Maya, I’m not a comic reader  so maybe she’s important but her fight at the end I really didn’t care about. I loved Kate and the show is really about her so her big final fight was cool and Yelena is my favorite MCU character and her fight with Clint was the highlight of the show for me so whenever it switched back to Maya I really didn’t care lol

- the tall bald dude wasent introduced until like episode 5 so he had no character development and he really wasent a character I wanted to see taken down, and that’s when you know the villain sucks 

Pros 

- Yelena ❤️

- Seeing Jeremy Renner back and FINALLY get his time to shine was amazing, if anyone deserves it it’s him and I love his ending 

- Kate is a Likable character 

- Jack was amazing im glad they didn’t make him into a Douche like I thought they were going to

- Kate turning her mom into the police was a very heartfelt moment, I meant that’s HER MOM for crying out loud which was extremely hard but it was the right decision and makes Kate even more likable

She brought the Skrull Kree War to Earth. 

She promised a new homeland for Skrulls, not Fury and left her planet and her friends to help the Skrulls. And the fact that she couldn’t find a planet suitable for Skrulls is honestly too far-fetched and make Carol look bad and useless

What they should have done was just establish there is also a bad group of Skrulls that do infiltrate civilization like the Krees said in the first movie.This could have been the major story that could help grow Carol’s character. She dedicated decades to protecting Skrulls and a section of them backstabbing her and trying to destabilize her home planet could have been a great personal crisis for her. 

People saying she is too OP. She needs to know who the enemy is to punch them, This is exactly the type where she cant punch her way out and has to use her brain to find out who is the Skrull. And it's not like they can't find other ways like they are already doing in The Marvels with teleportation or straight up really nerfing her like in Multiverse of Madness. 

How cool would have been a proper Captain Marvel v Superskrull fight instead of the discount version we got now?

From the initial looks The Marvels seem to be about Kamala and Krees, I think this is the end of the Skrull saga in MCU. It is a shame they are closing the Skrull story without the main character."

I understand that the threat of Skrulls is the fact that they can disguise themselves as humans and that would likely never allow them to be accepted by humans. However, Skrulls could just covertly blend in with New Asgard as some of the alien refugees that came along with them. Then they wouldn’t have to disguise themselves and could live in their true form. Plus the Kree wouldn’t have the balls to attack Earth again knowing who is defending it. 

Earth has shown they’re pretty ok with aliens and individuals who have abilities at this point. She Hulk showed an alien being represented in court and an entire firm dedicated to individuals with abilities. It should be a pretty simple fix to just sneak Skrulls into the population of New Asgard at this rate.

Maybe I’m way off and adding a million Skrulls to New Asgard is too unbelievable, but I’d love to hear what y’all have to add."
