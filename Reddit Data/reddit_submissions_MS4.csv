‘Secret Invasion’ director doesn’t “feel bad” about disappointing “rabid” Marvel fans: “is it our job to fulfil their expectations?”,ChubbyAsianPana,3734,https://www.nme.com/news/secret-invasion-director-doesnt-feel-bad-about-disappointing-rabid-marvel-fans-is-it-our-job-to-fulfil-their-expectations-3474957,1690751846.0,

Its the only mcu show that I've rewatched some episodes of. I still don't like the beginning few episodes but the final 3 were really fun imo especially the daredevil episode it was done almost perfectly and the rest of the show had some pretty fun moments like when pug and niki get the knock off avongers merch or wrong and madisson. It's not my favourite show but I like most of it now and it really wasn't as bad as I remember well atleast the final 3 or 4 episodes the first few weren't amazing. This actually felt like a tv show instead of a 4 or 6 hour movie which was nice. Don't get me wrong alot of the shows are better like loki wandavisin and moonknight but I still like it

I'm going to say it. I'd rather have a 20-22 episode run with some filler episodes than a truncated 5-6 episode series with little time for story telling or character development.,APater6076,1257,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15duawf/im_going_to_say_it_id_rather_have_a_2022_episode/,1690745970.0,"As you can probably tell, I'm a huge proponent of Agents of Shield and it's long runs of 22 episodes where it was possible to show effective and lengthy stories where characters could be shown to grow, form opinions, perhaps even change their minds or take actions that were the opposite of their views in previous seasons.

Having these ultra short, 6 or 7 episode mini-series makes effective story telling extremely difficult. It's next to impossible to show any real character development that doesn't feel pushed or forced, it makes it very difficult to weave multiple plots and subplots into anything and it really makes the story have to be centered around only one or two characters. One of the crowning achievements of AoS was building the team, seeing all the characters become like a family, working as a team, developing and sometimes losing together. These min-series can't build that camaraderie, that team ethic, those feelings of respect and trust. Everything is over far too quickly as there's a pressing need to wrap everything up neatly.

Disney is currently falling, and failing at their D+ Series because they're too short. It feels forced, rushed and over too quickly for any meaningful story to be written, developed and come to an end because it all needs to be wrapped up nicely by episode 6 or 7. It never feels satisfying, always a bit of a damp squib, an anti-climax.

Disney needs to take a step back, to work on quality over a longer period than these short, sharp busts that just let people down. I'd absolutely love a 10 or even 20 episode series because with a service like D+ it doesn't matter if you miss an episode like it did on Broadcast TV, and not every episode needs to have huge explosions, massive amounts of CGI and massive budgets. Hell, get the AoS crew back together and restart the show again, they've shown they can work to a strict, and ever diminishing budget throughout their run.

Anyway, that's my little rant. More storytelling and scene setting, more character development over a longer period and less 'whizz-bang' shows over far too quickly please Disney. Thanks for coming to my TED talk."

"FYI: Secret Invasion changed showrunners after principal photography and the new showrunner significantly rewote every single episode and held reshoots for 4 months, essentially reshooting the series anew. The result we got is a combination of 2 separate creative visions blended and edited together.",KostisPat257,3926,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dkt12/fyi_secret_invasion_changed_showrunners_after/,1690721312.0,"[Mr. Robot Writer Kyle Bradstreet was announced to be the series showrunner/head writer back in October 2020 when the show was first announced as an ""Untitled Nick Fury Series""](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/nick-fury-series-samuel-l-jackson-disney-plus-1234782313/)

The show then held principal phorgaphy from [September 1st 2021](https://filmlondon.org.uk/latest/september-2021-london-on-screen-and-filming) to [late April 25th 2022](https://www.cbr.com/secret-invasion-wraps-filming-new-nick-fury-organization-logo-mcu/) while Samuel L. Jackson was [hopping between the set of this show and the set of The Marvels](https://hypebeast.com/2022/3/marvel-samuel-l-jackson-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-the-marvels-appearances), which was being filmed almost concurrently (June 2021-November 2021).

[Then, in July 2022, Christopher McDonald who played FXN News Anchor Chris Stearns, the Tucker Carlson parody, in the series, revealed that they were about to start reshoots at the end of that month (July 25th 2022) and that a new writer was involved who ""has amped it up, and the series is going so much deeper than before.""](https://www.cbr.com/secret-invasion-reshoots-better-deeper-story-christopher-mcdonald-marvel/)

After that, Secret Invasion and The Marvels started reshoots, once again concurrently to reduce the time Samuel L. Jackson would need to be on set, which [lasted for 4 whole months](https://thedirect.com/article/mcu-secret-invasion-reshoots-disney-rumor) (Late July-Late November 2022), although Jackson had wrapped all his filming for SI by August 12, 2022 before moving on to The Marvels set.

With the series now released, it's been revealed that **this new writer is Brian Tucker**, who is credited as a **co-writer for episodes 1, 3, 5 and 6** (meaning he wrote at least 1/3rd of the final shooting script for those 4 episodes) and the **sole writer of episodes 2 and 4** (although episode 2 has Brant Englestein billed with a ""story by"" credit along with Tucker, meaning Tucker only kept minimal elements of the episode's story that was originall written by Englestein). 

Tucker is also credited as an executive producer, with his name credited above Kyle Bradstreet's, the original showrunner and creator of the series, meaning he, for all intents and purposes, took over as showrunner (head writer + executive producer) for the entire duration of the reshoots and **heavily, if not entirely, rewrote every single episode.**

What's also interesting is that Brian must have been hired between April 25th and July 25th 2022 and thus **had less than 3 months(!) to rewrite almost the entire series and then 4 months to shoot it** with Samuel L. Jackson shooting all his scenes in just 3 weeks!! 

To add on that, **Tucker had only written 1(!) film in his entire career**, Broken City, starring Mark Wahlberg, **a movie with a 28% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, before he took on this monumental task of rewriting an entire Marvel show in less than 3 months and successfully run/produce it through 4 whole months of reshoots**.

Not only is this show a chopilly blended/edited version of 2 separate creative visions, but the second person had almost 0 experience and success in his career. Even if Bradstreet's version was worse than what we got and Marvel Studios needed to salvage it, what were they thinking when they hired Brian Tucker to do something so incredibly hard in such little time when his resume would have you believe that he is basically incompetent?

&amp;#x200B;

This whole situation eerily reminds of Justice League and the Zack Snyder/Joss Whedon situation and it baffles me how Marvel Studios ended up repeating one of DC's greatest mistakes in recent memory.

Tbf, I still enjoyed watching SI and loved the acting, the tone, the production design, the music and I truly some of the dialogue (especially in episode 2) is some of the MCU's best.

I just feel like sometimes some characters and plot points felt kinda incosistent and incoherent in-between episodes and the story and villain felt lackluster because the series followed the ""tell and not show"" method. But my biggest gripe which disappointed me and left me undewhelmed is how the show was a Nick Fury drama instead of the paranoia/mystery thriller that it was marketed as."

Reassembled after the fall of SHIELD and went after Hydra. 

Then fought Ultron. Tony Thor Clint and Banner leave. Rhodey, Wanda, Sam, and Vision join the team.

We never see this team in action in its entirety. Vision and Rhodey are missing from the Lagos mission. We also never see any of the support personnel from the end of AOU ever again. Fury and Hill disappear without explanation although it’s set up that SHIELD was reborn within the Avengers organization.

Ant-Man oddly shows the Avengers compound empty with no one but Falcon there.

Civil War happens team splits into two. 

Homecoming was supposed to have Vision and Rhodey assisting Tony on the ferry. It seems like at the point Tony’s “team” is pretty much inactive due to the accords. I’m sure Rhodey conducted more missions for the US. Still no mention or sight of support personnel outside of a Quinjet taking off.

We have no idea what Steve’s Secret Avengers were up to by the time they show up in Infinity War. Of course we know they were conducting missions but it would’ve been nice to address it with a line or two. Name drop some obscure villains. 

The snap happens and in those five years we get an understanding the Avengers have become a network over watching Earth and the stars. And Hulk is his own beloved hero but we’re told not shown. (Which is ok)

Post blip the Avengers seem to not exist which is IMO a huge mistake. In MCU time we are now in 2026. (So three years post blip).  Strange alludes to a team existing and the end of Shang Chi does too. Again it seems the team is very much not a full fledged organization but just a loose network of heroes in communication. My concern is if the rumors are true we’ll see Sam put together a team at the end of Brave New World, ignore them in Thunderbolts, and more than likely lose in Kang Dynasty."

I hope that the Minds behind the MCU honor and respect the characters. The X-men are not something to be taken lightly. People like myself have grown up with them. I Can only hope that they listen to the fans, consult the greats who wrote, drew, and breathed life into these characters and take their time to focus on story and character instead of spectacle.

Yes I know that the MCU has from the beginning taken some deviations, but some of those seemed logical or just simplified things for what they have.

Yes Civil War is different from the comics in a lot of ways, but you could still feel the spirit of that event. I could tell the Russos or (the writers) actually read that event and wanted to use the pieces they had to make something similar.

I will also acknowledge that some people are so talented they can capture the spirit of the comics without reading them like Jac Schaeffer (writer of Wandavision).

I just would prefer the characters at least feel like the characters from the comics and the stories seemed more cohesive.

From phase 4 onward nothing has felt like a love for the source material and even if they use some elements of the comics (L&amp;T) they still feel badly integrated."

When a project wraps everything, including reshoots, does Feige actually watch the finished product? Does the director of the show/film? Or is the entire studio accepting the risk of releasing something that hasn't been viewed in its entirety by anyone, especially when reshoots and new writers have come aboard? I don't know anything about the industry, but some of the poorer quality projects cause me to wonder whether anyone at the top actually saw what was going to be on the screen before its release.

Could Secret Invasion Set Up an MCU Siege?,OpeningResearch8804,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15e8f0n/could_secret_invasion_set_up_an_mcu_siege/,1690786032.0,"Like many Secret Invasion wasn’t my cup of tea. Honestly, some of the things I found the most interesting were happening in the last few minutes, like Ritson basically declaring war on aliens. 

So that got me wondering about Asgard, since they’re technically aliens now on Earth, and made me think of the Siege event. For those who don’t know, a short synopsis is the US government declares war on Asgard since it’s been relocated above the US. There’s a lot more but that’s the general premise. Now we know Ritson is gonna get replaced by Ross by the next Captain America, but maybe that xenophobic sentiment still remains in the government. 

I think Siege could work as a new Thor movie and could strike a different tone from previous Thor iterations, especially as he’s forced to have to fight against humans to defend his people. 

Now a major character of the Siege storyline is Norman Osborn who’s leading the strike against Asgard for the government with the Dark Avengers. While Osborn’s existence in the MCU is questionable to unlikely, we do have a government-affiliated character of questionable morality who’s setting up a team of less than good-aligned individuals: Valentina and the Thunderbolts. They’re not 1 to 1 but it’s not the most insane replacement to have Valentina coordinating this strike on Asgard using her team. And if the rumors are true, Sentry may be introduced in Thunderbolts (which would be a point towards this since Sentry is a major character of the Siege story too). Granted we don’t know what will happen in the Thunderbolts movie, but if it ends with Sentry captured or on the team and them aligned within the government, it wouldn’t be a stretch. 

It could honestly be an interesting crossover of Thor and Thunderbolts not unlike Civil War. And it could provide an impactful end to Thor if they wanted him to die. No idea if it’s what would happen, and I’m sure there’s a lot of other kinks or issues with this idea, but it was fun to think of a possible way things could go."

"A lot of people want to bring down ""The Marvels,"" but they don't know the consequences of doing that.",Factsonlyon,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ekwyc/a_lot_of_people_want_to_bring_down_the_marvels/,1690821046.0,"A lot of people on the internet, many of whom call themselves hardcore MCU fans, want to bring down Captain Marvel 2, aka The Marvels. But do these people know what would be its consequence? Captain Marvel is very likely to lead the Avengers in the MCU. Marvel has made her the Avengers leader in comics, so it's very likely that they will do the same in the MCU. Recently, Feige said that Winter Soldier is the de facto leader in the Thunderbolts movie, and now they've announced a Winter Soldier lead Thunderbolts comics, so what they're doing in comics, they're doing the same in the MCU. Now what I noticed is that many hardcore fans of Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, or Wanda are at the forefront of hating Captain Marvel and Brie Larson. The Marvels trailer is the least watched movie trailer in this saga; I believe that a consistent hate campaign against the character and the actress has made a lot of casual fans disinterested in Captain Marvel, and because of this, they might have been disinterested in Avengers movies too, and because of this, they might have been disinterested in the overarching storyline; people just don't realize this now as there is still no clarity about who the leads will be in the next Avengers movies. If her haters think that the hate campaign against Captain Marvel will only damage the Marvels and have no impact on their favorite characters movies, then they're wrong, because if the general audience loses interest in Avengers movies and the overarching storyline, its negative impact will also be seen in the next Spider-Man movie, the next Doctor Strange movie, and other Avengers-related characters movies. In short, they're not just bringing down the Marvels but also the movies of their favorites."

Could we make a petition or something so this can be revisited? Because this just doesn’t sit right with me, they deserve so much better. 

When I watched the first movie, I thought that Rocket was a bit aloof and a too cold and it made me think he was a bit of an arrogant so and so, but now I realise why he is the way he is and with me being autistic, I realised that like myself, he was just misunderstood and that made me relate to him so much.

I'd just like to know some folks' opinions on what actually is Quantumania's problem. The movie was alright, I had fun at the cinema. I honestly didn't see any visuals bad enough to pull me out of the movie.

I think there's nothing that wrong with the movie itself, except that it didn't live up to the hype. Kang specially was really disappointing to me. The guy's supposed to be the new Thanos, but I've seen him getting his ass kicked by one single Ant-man. He didn't simply kick his ass. He completely obliterated it.

It didn't really  live up to the 'start of the new Marvel era' expectations. And of course, there's the Marvel fatigue.

I'm not even trying to defend the movie, it definitely didn't know how to land. I just wanted to comment on how movies get dragged down by their context, and see if anyone else agrees.."
Was Falcon and the Winter Soldier bad?,r0b666,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15doe56/was_falcon_and_the_winter_soldier_bad/,1690731047.0,"Most people seem to rate FATWS somewhere in the middle to lower tier of the MCU Disney + shows. I am not saying it was the best (I easily put Loki, Hawkeye and WandaVison over it) but it seems like a lot of fans, content creators and critics hate on it and I don't understand why.

Yes there were weak spots:

- The Flag Smashers and Karlie (sp?) were kind of annoying and all over the place

-  The Power Broker stoyline/reveal didn't make a ton of sense

-  Sam's speech at the end is a little corny/cringey

But the show had some great performances, characters (Zemo, the Dora Milaje, Isiah Bradley, John Walker, Val) and action sequences (The opening arial battle, Sam and Bucky vs. Walker) and told a good story that showed character development and growth for several characters including the two leads (Sam accepting the mantle of Captain America, Bucky's Redemption arc).

I have seen many put Moon Knight over it, and while I really enjoyed Moon Knight I don't see how. While they handle DID very well having a lot of the action/fights happen during ""blackouts"" seemed like a major cop out to me (especially  in the finale).

Again, I am not saying it was the best show, but a lot of beloved MCU shows and movies have weak villians, underwhelming finales, or subplots that go nowhere/make no sense,  and get far less criticism.

So what am I missing here?"

Scott’s internal monologue about if he really won was probably another major clue to the audience, even if he downplays it later as overthinking.

Wasn’t a fan of the movie overall, even after a rewatch, but I’ll give credit where it’s due, the ending was really unsettling, whether he’s in an alternate reality, or different timeline, or if he ever truly got out of the Quantum Realm. Either way, this is similar to WandaVision’s eerie vibe of things not feeling right, even if there are fake smiles plastered everywhere. One of the few positives of the movie, tbh, it did give that sense of paranoia somewhat, and I’m not sure if that was the intention or not, but if they were trying to give the movie a happy ending, it made me feel the opposite"

I think it could be a very crazy and dark storyline if the mcu writers (if they ever make the young avengers movie or show) would have the young avengers come together and not take being superheroes as dangerous until, someone from the team dies or is seriously wounded in a fight. This could shake things up a bit and the young avengers remaining could have a storyline deciding if being a superhero is what they really want to do, depression from the event (along with ptsd), or something like that. And then they all decide (on their own) that it is what they want to do or need to do. Then they treat being a superhero more maturly and seriously then take down the big bad (someone who is a household name even if not well known instead of an original mcu villain)

Of course if would definitely be tweaked but what ideas or add one would u like if they made the young avengers a movie or show?"

We had ONE possible Skrull spy in this show - Rhodey, who was pretty obvious just by process of elimination - and we kept being shown what the villains were doing, so there was no mystery or dread. Fury should have had an ensemble of characters around him, so we would constantly be guessing who we could and couldn't trust.

Where did the $212 million go?,thedelisnack,6235,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15cu34b/where_did_the_212_million_go/,1690642006.0,"Secret Invasion, a Disney+ miniseries, cost $212 million for six episodes. That’s ~$35 million per episode. There were two (maybe three) major action set pieces and one of those was CGI-heavy. Most of the show itself was in closed rooms, hallways, empty warehouses, train cars, abandoned alleyways, and cars. It had a stacked cast with Sam Jackson, Emilia Clarke, Martin Freeman, etc. But just one more episode would have made Secret Invasion cost the same as Captain America: Civil War. 

So where the hell did the money go?

Edit: The council has reached a verdict. 

Sam Jackson took $100 million right off the top. The rest went to 4 months of reshoots, Drax’s CGI arm, designer drugs, an AI script, a skrull sex scene (unfortunately) left on the cutting room floor, and Kathleen Kennedy’s company-wide money laundering scheme."

But if you think about this scene from Peter’s point of view it’s a perfectly reasonable moment. Peter has never had a chance to grieve, moments after his mother died he was abducted by Ravagers, and from there was likely taught to toughen up. Yondu was the first death Peter had since his mother and by the time of Infinity War it’s entirety possible he’s still processing it. And then on Titan as Thanos tells him of his lover’s murder by him of course he’s going to lose it, he’s never had a chance to healthily cope. And it’s not irrational for him to get mad quickly, look at how he reacted when Ego let slip he killed Quill’s mother. Is this money frustrating? Yes.

It addresses all the post endgame ptsd and sets up Kang as the new villain for the next saga. It ends with avengers being transported to another universe where we continue our next saga. We don't see these heroes for a long time now. The new universe sets up all new characters we have got as of now, phase 1 style. There are new rules that can retcon bad MCU decisions and change things for better stories ahead(like in this universe the skrulls were just like the comics).

We have got too many characters now. Wanda is my favourite character but she was an avengers supporting character/ secondary lead, she got her well deserved show as lead and now her supporting character Agatha got her own spin-off. Do we really need shows on midnight angels and 10 rings? It's like if phase one had Disney+ we would have had 6 movies plus shows on war machine, howling commandos, Nick fury, agents of shield(setting up Hawkeye, bw and Maria hill), heimdall and a special on Justin hammer setting him up only for him to come back after 10 years.
Seriously, they should soft reboot every saga. If you miss the older movies, np you will understand everything and if you have seen them, you'll get something in return like small Easter eggs and reference which are not the most important for you to understand the ongoing story. They might lose some fans but also get new ones who want to join the new MCU. Rn they are just losing fans, idk if anyone would like to watch 32 movies, 8 live action shows, 1 animated show, 2 special presentations and 1 animated shorts(also can't forget the one-shots we had in phase 1 and 2) to hop onto the MCU train. Seriously, i can't even start Star wars with just 9 movies and a few shows.

Tl;dr- Apart from all the rant, they should have soft rebooted the mcu after endgame keeping only the main leads(not their supporting characters), passed the baton to new characters to set up new universe and slowly integrate the old characters into the story."

At this point, is Quantumania most likely the last Ant-Man movie we’ll ever see? Obviously Scott and the rest of the family will return in Avengers 5 and 6, but I don’t see much in store for them after that.

While seeing the series go back to it’s smaller scale routes would be nice, I don’t know if that’s possible at this point. Since Ant-Man and Wasp have literally defeated a conqueror of universes without the help of the Avengers, another street level villain would look like a joke in comparison."

They are analysing the past events and realising they cannot fight against the superheroes and so they begin kidnapping scientists in an effort to level the playing field. Super-Skrulls.

Any time a Skrull disagrees, the Skrull is sent for re-education and comes out fully supporting ""The Plan"".

Near the end of the episode, he is consumed by Alioth with his FINAL WORDS being 'Glorious Purpose'.

It's crazy because Classic Loki is technically a version of Loki that we were used to up until Infinity War,

So far almost everything they've put out has entertained me, and I don't think Secret Invasion is an exception. 

There were some very good parts to this series, imo. The initial characterisation of Fury, showing his 'fall from grace'. 

The tone of the show being something a bit different.

The relationship between Fury and Talos.

The part with the nuclear submarine I found really quite tense.

Maria Hill's funeral, especially the convo with her mother at the end, I found quite hard hitting.

Fury's poetic shootout with his wife.

The idea - however it was explored - of there being a sect of Skrulls who are sick and tired of being misled and 'toyed with' by Marvel and Fury. Played right, it could've made for an EXCEPTIONAL villain with understandable, even sympathetic, motives. 

But the elements people criticise - the lack of paranoia, for example - very easily could've remedied by simply dedicating more time to it.

Have an episode on Gravik, and episode on Skrull Rodey (making him an independent character with his own views and motivations), even an episode dedicated to Fury's initial attempts to find homeworlds - each of them sadly failing for one reason or another.

Perhaps we introduce the Kree as a minor threat that impedes progress. They demand Skrulls be kept to Earth, where they can be controlled and, if necessary, eliminated."
I feel like the problem with phase 4 and 5 so far has been the rising level of mediocrity not the rising of just straight up bad stuff,DraconicRaptor,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dfge3/i_feel_like_the_problem_with_phase_4_and_5_so_far/,1690702566.0,"Phase 1,2 and 3 had about a 60% hit rate(Iron man 1, Avengers, Infinity war, etc) with 20% being mediocre(Thor, Iron man 3, ant man the wasp, etc) and 20% being misses(Iron man 2, Hulk, Thor the dark world, etc).

Back in 2016, I started an [MCU viewing order](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xfe--9Wshbb3ru0JplA2PnEwN7mVawazKmhWJjr_wKs/edit#gid=0) for myself and my friends. As the MCU expanded with all the Marvel TV shows, it got increasingly more complicated (and fun) so I figured I would send it on this subreddit for feedback and people seemed to love it! The mods here were kind enough to put it on the sidebar, in the Wiki, and in some AutoModerator automation. (Also thank you mods for letting me make this post)

As time went on, there were certain episodes, movies, or ads that I had trouble placing but with the help of this subreddit's Discord server (Shoutout LB and Dennis), I was able to fully complete it for the time being.

Now here is where the trouble comes from: **Deadpool 3.**

# (If you have not been following the news/rumor cycle, stop reading now.)

With No Way Home, it was pretty easy to add in 5 movies from the other Spider-Man franchises but X-Men makes it a lot more difficult (also I have not seen more of the X-Men universe movies which makes this even harder)

Then on top of that, now it looks like the old Daredevil movies are going to be somehow connected.

All of this combined leaves me in quite a pickle: **Where the heck do I place everything?**

Obviously, we can't know for sure until Deadpool 3 comes out but I think we can all make an estimated guess. All we know for sure is it's sometime after Loki season 1. So please leave your f**eedback/ideas in the comments** so I can be ready to implement them when the time comes (or even now so people can prepare in advance?)

Thank you!

I think it's time to say goodbye...,3dsgamer21,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15enpdw/i_think_its_time_to_say_goodbye/,1690827531.0,"Hey, if you clicked on this you're probably really confused about this title and want me to elaborate, or you already know exactly what I'm about to say. I think Marvel lost their 'touch', maybe I'm growing up or have been spoiled by the cultivated masterpiece of the Infinity Saga. But no matter what Marvel show/movie I watch, I just don't feel the same spark and warm connection I had to the characters that I used to have as a kid. Now not all content from Marvel has been disappointing lately... quite frankly I found Guardians 3 really enjoyable and emotional along with many of my friends. But the problem for me is that I don't look forward to any of their future projects anymore. I'm over the whole upcoming ""Secret Wars"" arc even though it has barely started. Personally, I think I lost interest in the stakes of these movies, especially when they became so broadened out. What I mean by this is instead of the heroes addressing the fate of the world, we now have a whole multiverse with almost infinite variations of the same character, let alone an infinite number of superheroes to worry about. There's just too much going on, and I can't find myself to relate to these stories when I don't even know the implications or danger/""threat"" at hand. Another big issue is the lack of enough time to tell a character's story, after recently watching Secret Invasion, I was surprised that &gt;!Nick Fury had a wife (and a scrull one at that!). !&lt;Don't get me wrong that was pretty unexpected but also heart warming to know that even a guy like him needs some company. But the issue I had was that I just didn't care much about &gt;!Varra!&lt;. Like maybe if the series was longer and we got to know their relationship a bit more with all the ups and downs I would have cared much more to see them reunite together at the end. But When you have as little as 6 episodes to tell a portion of that story, I just don't understand why I and many others would care about it.

Alas I'm not here to spread negativity, I think Marvel gave myself and many others a chance to take even a concept like superheroes seriously. I mean let's be real, we're laughing, crying, getting emotional for some of these characters that in the bigger scope of things are the prime examples of fiction. Props to the writers, producers and other outstanding people at Marvel for making this happen.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Marvel's new projects don't feel 'grounded' or relatable anymore as the stakes are too large for my tiny brain to fathom (multiverse, variants etc.). I really enjoyed the Infinity Saga, and understand that I've probably been spoiled with how good and well written almost every single movie in that time frame was. With that said I guess all good things must come to an end.

Thanks for reading."

It's a shame that Batroc in these movies is now dead because their touching mentor-student bond could have been an unexpected highpoint of the new MCU going forward.

It would also give some measure of cathartic release to the armchair ""If I were writing these movies"" superfans that have taken to writing sharp, biting criticisms of the modern 2020s MCU.

Captain Marvel/Secret Invasion plot hole or not?,AugustineBlackwater,259,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15czdtc/captain_marvelsecret_invasion_plot_hole_or_not/,1690655699.0,"*Edit for clarity; 
Either her powers are or aren't in her DNA - the focus here is that the films contradict each other. Danvers makes its clear they can already easily replicate DNA without a sample but also shows that her powers aren't in her DNA since they can't photo blast despite being able to easily replicate her DNA*

In CM, Fury asks Carol to 'prove' it's her and not a skrull - her response is to blast jukebox because 'skrulls can't do that'. However, when Fury offers spit, she also says that it won't work because skrulls can copy DNA and it would just show Fury's DNA. 

However, Gravic gained Carol's powers through her DNA and the machine, so presumably, her powers are intrinsically linked to her DNA - which begs two major questions: since skrulls can assume her form with identical DNA, 

Why couldn't they demonstrate her powers just by taking her form, since Gravic could have just 'copied' her DNA without the machine?
Or alternatively, why did her DNA give them her powers, since they couldn't have used her powers even if they copied her DNA like CM suggests? 

The whole 'you can't copy superpowers' is inherently illogical because for some characters they're not superpowers, they're normal parts of their biology. Presumably, for Asgardians, being able to lift more amounts than humans isn't a superpower, since they can all do it to varying degrees."

I think a lot of the issues stem from not having a culminating film at the end of Phase 4.,NaiadoftheSea,184,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15cz9pg/i_think_a_lot_of_the_issues_stem_from_not_having/,1690655418.0,"A main reason the MCU felt so connected and made people care was that we knew every few years there would be an Avengers movie uniting many of the established characters and plot lines that would also impact the MCU at large. 

Phase 1 had The Avengers, the first time superheroes publicly united against an alien threat, changing the way people saw the world.

Phase 2 had Avengers: Age of Ultron, which created the distrust many people have for superheroes after the creation of Ultron and the destruction of Sokovia.

Phase 3 had twice as many productions as the previous phase, and also had an increased amount of culminating films. Captain America: Civil War, which deals swiftly with the distrust people have for superheroes and the fallout of the team. 

Then of course we got Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, which united everyone including the Guardians of the Galaxy with the Avengers, and dealt the final blow to Thanos and his army. It also established the Blip.

Then we get to Phase 4. And there are no culminating films that provide a sense of payoff or have an impact on what is going on. Because of this, there has been no follow up for what seemed to be some major new characters like Shang-Chi and the Eternals. Some of the stories feel disconnected from the rest as well like Moon Knight and Werewolf By Night.

Between Phases 4 and 5, this is the most amount of productions being made without making a movie that brings these characters together.

At least Phase 5 does have a culminating film coming up with Thunderbolts.

If there was a culminating film made for Phase 4, what would you have wanted it to be?"
I hope Secret Wars just reboots the MCU altogether.,hushpolocaps69,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15e693w/i_hope_secret_wars_just_reboots_the_mcu_altogether/,1690778495.0,"So I know Secret Wars is a longs way from now and we still have a lot of projects to have moving forward, but I’d figured I’d share since it’s an interesting topic to discuss.


If I’m not mistaken, the MCU is by far the longest living cinematic universe to date, starting in 2008 and 2000 if you wanna get all technical with the multiverse. Regardless, it’s definitely one of the longer living cinematic universes when you consider how the DCEU just ended or how franchises such as Star Wars is barely starting to open their branches in Hollywood. 



You see, by the time Secret Wars comes out a ton of the cast are going to be significantly older than when they started. Sure you could have an older Spider-Man which would be an interesting take, but then you have characters such as Kamala who has always been a teenager 24/7. There’s also just the idea that actors may get tired of playing their characters, which is why Vol 3 kinda ended weirdly (cause trust me if all the actors or Gunn were still on board then the Guardians would’ve never disbanded). 




Lately the MCU has been feeling off and I don’t blame the actors but this never happens in the comics. A character can never retire since it’s fiction, meaning someone like Iron Man can keep going and going. Of course in real life though, RDJ wanted a break and rightfully deserved one hence why Iron Man dies in Endgame but it works well since it fits the story. I highly doubt we’ll get that  lucky again such as if Simu Liu just wants to leave after Secret Wars for an example (assuming he only signed for a few projects). They couldn’t resign him if he truly feels disconnected.





Another big reason why I want a reboot is because I miss certain characters. Iron Man and Cap were such good characters and it’s a real shame how we won’t see them be involved in all these cool plots and stories. 



Finally, the MCU is kinda getting out of hand thanks to certain decisions. I understand Feige never had the X-Men in mind, but now that Disney owns Fox I feel as though he’s just shoehorning the X-Men (like Ms. Marvel) or will simply use the multiverse to bring them which I find extremely lame. Mutants is a huge plot and it should definitely be incorporated since the beginning, that way we can have characters such as Logan fighting alongside Cap during the WWII or the discrimination they face for decades. 




Secret Wars is also the perfect way to do a reboot since that’s exactly what the writers in the comics intended and it would honestly be a win win situation. Fans can have a fresh start and have it simple like Phase 1, actors wanting to leave can now do it, we get to have iconic characters back such as Iron Man, and the newer generation of Marvel fans experience what we had rather than going into the next saga having to have all this knowledge of the Infinity saga and Multiverse saga.

Is the Multiverse Saga going in the right direction?,MrDoom4e5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dp6he/is_the_multiverse_saga_going_in_the_right/,1690733056.0,"To me, the main focus of Phase 4, 5, and 6, the Multiverse, has not yet been explored. Only Spider-man: No Way Home, Doctor Strange, Loki, What If? and Quantumania have focused on the multiverse story so far - 3 out of 9 movies, and 2 out of 9 streaming shows. Even No Way Home only used the multiverse storyline to do a tie-in to the previous Spider-man franchises and a hard reset to Peter Parker, so Sony has the liberty to do their own not MCU cannon stories with Spiderman, not to contribute to the MCU's multiverse phase.

Looking to the rest of Phase 5 and 6, I fail to see how the Multiverse Saga will continue to be explored, at least until Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. Besides Loki season 2, none of the other movies or shows are going to be related to the Multiverse in any way that I can see.

Meanwhile Talos who's weaker than him and Gravik could have killed him on the spot in episode 3 if he wanted to, felt more intimating and menacing than the main bad guy and he did all of that without the need of the super skrull enhancement.

You have the expected difficulties:
- Having to meet the colossal expectations set by Infinity War and Endgame
- Having to introduce new characters while simultaneously continue the story arcs of the already established ones

You have difficulties created by their own recent (but understandable) choices:
- Having to juggle movies and tv series in a same continuity (for real, this time)
- Having to juggle different timelines and universes

And finally you have the unexpected difficulties:
- COVID
- Chadwick Boseman's death
- Jonathan Majors' situation
- The strikes

All these things combined (and probably more that I could be forgetting) aren't making things easy for Feige, for sure."

* Black Widow (+) Yelena is one of the best additions to the MCU in phase 4. I loved her dynamic within the BW family.
* Black Widow (-) Taskmaster should have been  an actual character, and also should have used her 'mimic' powers more often. It was cool but seemed underused. I want MORE.
* Shang Chi (+) The action choreography with the Ten Rings were AMAZING. They got so much right in  their first try.
* Shang Chi (-) I wish the final fight was more about the family altogether instead of mythical beasts...
* Eternals (+) As a Korean, seeing Don Lee in the MCU was unreal! His iconic 'don lee' slap even made it in haha
* Eternals (-) I couldn't relate to any of the Eternals at all tbh, they were just there and now they sort of aren't(?) without a promise of when they'll return.
* NWH (+) It feel's like Tom owns the story but at the same time Tobey and Andrew's spider-men also got closure and provided fitting guidance. They weren't just reference machines.
* NWH (-) Ned's 'gift' kinda ruins everyone in Kamar-Taj's efforts including Strange, AND makes Chavez's ending in MoM to master the sling ring very weird.
* DS:Mom (+) The 'traveling the multiverse' scene. It was short but it had great visuals, pacing, and it's what got me the most hyped up before the movie released.
* DS:MoM (-) ...proceeds to explore like, 2 universes where things are 90% the same.
* LaT (+) The black and white planet was unique with the lighting, had synergy with Gorr to make him even more unnerving, and also the action scenes were great.
* LaT (-) Thor learns it's not about the hammer \*5 years later\* I miss the hammer. I'd give anything for that hammer. Nope, not the cooler one that beat 5-stone Infinity Gauntlet. That hammer my dead dad told me I didn't need anymore.
* BP:WF (+) I did not expect Killmonger to return, it made so much impact to Shuri's character while being a twist that totally makes sense. It also made me re-realize Killmonger and T'challa were gone too soon.
* BP:WF (-) Riri explodes a police car and yells ""Woooooo!"", like come on, you're an MIT student, you should be freaking the fuck out, not enjoying shooting missiles at people just doing their jobs. That was weird.

Listen folks. I've seen it all. Post after post about how bad this show is but I thought it was a cool show. I do acknowledge some silly things they did. My biggest issue was how they squandered the whole ""secret invasion"" but nothing can be done now. Anyway I am going to list the things I really liked in this show 

Samuel L Jackson is always great and fun to watch. My favourite line was ""are you out of your skrull as mind!?""

Olivia Colman was of course very good and I hope to see her again in the MCU.

It seemed like Don Cheadle really liked playing a bad guy and there was a very clear difference between evil Rhodey and good Rhodey so that was also fun to watch.

The banter between Talos and Fury was great and I even laughed out loud at one point.

the budget for this is insane but it definitely shows. Nothing looked cheaply made and it looked like a crisp A list show. 

I realize the final fight looked a little goofy (Maw's rings lol) but it LOOKED amazing. The CGI was on point for that scene and it was really cool to see all the powers and characters from the past show up again. 

So not a great show but not as HORRIBLE as everyone says."
Possible MCU Fantastic Four villains,Traditional-Key2379,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15di6fy/possible_mcu_fantastic_four_villains/,1690712590.0,"Here's a list of villains I think could be the villain of the upcoming MCU fantastic Four movie:

(Due to the movie being more space themed only space villains)

Red Ghost

While he's far from the FF's most famous villains he is still one of their most dangerous foes and actually has a notable mark in their history, being the reason that they would end up meeting The Watcher. He also has an origin similar to the FF meaning he could be portrayed as having been part of the same test flight as them. The only reason why I don't see him being the villain is due to the super apes which is somewhat of an absurd premise even if it's the same universe with a talking raccoon and a living tree. Maybe they could make it so the apes to mutate when they got their powers similarly to the animals in the movie Rampage.

Annihilus

Probably one of the FF's most iconic villains to date. It would also put the FF in one of their most iconic locations, being the negative zone. While Annihilus is far from an complex villain he could easily be Disney villain level of entertaining with his unhinged and completely evil personality, basically being the Jack Horner of the MCU, Just being a selfish greedy pr\*ck., which I wouldn't mind since it would be nice to have a MCU villain that's just evil for their own selfish reasons but done right to. While some would want an full blown Avengers movie based on Annihilation, I doubt that's a storyline they will adapt.

&amp;#x200B;

Blastaar

If they DO plan to use Annihilus for a bigger role they could easily use Blastaar. A much lesser villain from the negative sone which the Fantastic Four could use. Blastaar being an warlord would have an army worth of soldiers that the the FF would have to fight alongside being an pretty powerful fighter. While he is a pretty generic villain even in the comics the FF fighting him could easily further expand the MCU negative zone. While he is probably amongst the least prominent character in this list he wouldn't bee a bad start as the MCU FF's first villain

Psycho-Man

While he is a villain that recedes in the micro verse the MCU could easily adapt him into being some kind of alien psychologist that seeks to manipulate emotion that the FF stumbles upon. Not only would he challenge the Fantastic Four physically but also emotionally and psychologically which would really put the team and their relationships with each other to the test. While forgettable he is one of Marvel's most dangerous villains and was and still is a major thorn to whoever fights him. He also has a major part in the FF's lives being responsible for the creation of malice and Sue's name change from Invisible Girl to Invisible Woman which more or less would see a permanent change in her character personality wise going forwards.

Terminus

While not even a rogues gallery level villain he is definitely one of the more dangerous ones the team has fought over the years and it would be pretty fitting for the FF to come together to stop an invading alien similarly to the Avengers which would really set up the FF as a team and the major role they will have in the MCU going forward.

Devos The Devastator

While even more minor of a villain than Terminus he is an interning one. While the FF is superheroes that fights world ending threats or people that want them dead they're also seeking to create peace by solving problems like world-hunger and illnesses. In the comics Devos is an alien with an extremely warped sense of justice, the MCU could adapt him to someone that really suffered due to things like Thanos, his planet's problems and so on including the problems they faced when everyone from the blip returned like on earth which has really messed things up. He could be like flag smasher but in space (and actually a good villain). He could really bring in a moral view into what the cost of peace is.

Aron The Rogue Watcher

The Watcher has more or less always been an ally to any heroes he helps both in the comics and in the MCU. Aron however is an extreme exception having replaced his uncle and manipulated the four to do what he wants. I think Aron as a character could really explore the watchers jobs and similarly also be about the FF's strive to solve major world problems as he could be represented as the one watcher that has had enough just watching while bad things happen and plans to destroy the other watchers that will probably stop him as well as well as revenge for their ""ignorant"" ways. Not only would it explore the watchers but it could also further explore the multiverse and their place in it. They could also portray it happening due to Aron being ""inspired"" by his uncle when he stopped Ultron and would  definitely have a moral dilemma with him about their interference and all that.

"In Ragnarok, why didn't Thor want Valkyrie knowing that Banner was Hulk?",AxelShoes,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15de8fp/in_ragnarok_why_didnt_thor_want_valkyrie_knowing/,1690698181.0,"Apologies if I'm an idiot and this was answered in the movie but I somehow missed it. But in *Ragnarok*, after Hulk turns back into Banner and he and Thor are trying to escape Sakaar, Valkyrie joins up with them. She says Banner looks familiar, but Thor clearly doesn't want Valkyrie to realize Banner is Hulk (nor for Banner to realize he knows Valkyrie), and I'm just curious, why? What problem would it cause if Valkyrie realized her ""big guy"" Hulk and Banner were one and the same?"
"I think it's time to be realistic and realize the MCU isn't a Cinematic universe anymore, it's a brand.",nudeldifudel,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15eb1f8/i_think_its_time_to_be_realistic_and_realize_the/,1690795052.0,"The MCU is exactly what Star wars is, it has turned into a brand. Something to slap on the boxs to sell you yet another product that ""definitely is important and connects to everything else guys, we swear it's in the same universe so you better go watch it"". Just as star wars has different movies, and tv shows and comics set in the same timeline and universe, it isn't a Cinematic universe, it's a brand. And thats what the MCU has turned into, just many different shows, and movies that are set in the same ""Universe"" and nothing else. 

When the MCU came out, it was advertised as a series of movies that connected with each other and formed a universe, and that was realized with the release of the Avengers, and continued on into the finale that was Infinity War/Endgame. 

But that's not what we have now. We have had no Avengers movies since then to tie it all together, no central overarching storyline beyond ""Kang"" and the vague premise of a ""multiverse"" and that's fine, but so far phase 4 and 5 doesn't feel like the multiverse saga or the Kang saga, it feels like a bunch of different stuff with some that happens to have Kang in them or involve the multiverse. 

The genius of the Infinity saga was that every movie or character had something to do with an infinity stone or Thanos, which made it all flow together naturally. But in phase 4 and 5 that's not the case. Most people have never heard of Kang, and most shows and movies have nothing to do with the multiverse. 

For example, if every show was set in another universe it would make more sense why they would all come together to save their respective universe in a future movie. Or have Any man 3 be a Avengers movie, which includes a bunch of characters from the different movies and shows we have seen so far and tie them together, and also making Kang a bigger focus and known to all our current heros. Not having an Avengers movie end each phase was a mistake.

TLDR: So what do you guys think? Do you still think there is hope that this all tied together in the end, or have you come to the same conclusion as me, that the MCU is no longer a connecting overall storyline but more of a brand, and just a universe to pump out different content in?"
"MCU's future will be decided by the fate of their films, not shows",am5011999,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dhjbx/mcus_future_will_be_decided_by_the_fate_of_their/,1690710311.0,"I have been hearing a lot of ""MCU is dying"" and ""MCU is dead"" arguments after a Disney+ show got bad reviews.   


SPOILER ALERT: 

***MCU's main business is the movies.***  The movies are what have made the MCU what it is and it is the movies that will decide its fate. 

Most general audience that have watched the MCU around the world, don't even bother to watch Disney+ shows. So the notion that bad Disney+ shows will kill the MCU doesn't have a lot of weight.  


MCU right now is in a special territory as compared to all other franchises. You see, most franchises right now, can't manage to make box office without good marketing, no matter how good their films are. Take Mission Impossible 7, the best reviews and audience scores, still it is on its way to lose money at the box office.  


But, for MCU, the brand name itself is enough marketing, which is a huge plus. The only thing that has to be done is for the films to have good to great reviews. Guardians 3 started with underwhelming pre-sales, given that it was following Quantumania, a very underwhelming MCU film that killed some audience interest in MCU for a while. But, once the reviews started to drop, those pre sales went up, and the film had a decent opening weekend but still lower than Guardians 2.   
But, the film's quality was such that it had a longer box office run instead of a short burst like most other MCU films, and made almost as much as Guardians 2.  


I feel Marvels will play in the same way as well. It will need good to great reviews to make good money at the box office. But, if the film has mediocre reviews or poor reviews, we could be seeing a box office possibly worse than Quantumania.  


So, I feel how good the next 3-4 MCU films are will be what decides the fate of the franchise as a whole

Like most people, I expected secret invasion to be a hard-nosed spy, thriller. While that thread ran throughout the entire series, climaxing with the assault on the presidential motorcade, the story ended with two very personal battles, Fury to personally save the day and prove that he still had what it takes, and Ga’ia to avenger her father. And the two final images of these two warriors each finding a home they thought they had lost I found very moving."
"Seriously, how is Marvel going to do it?",Paperchampion23,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dw9om/seriously_how_is_marvel_going_to_do_it/,1690750647.0,"Less a post about ""quality"" and more about direction for this franchise as Id probably have the same concerns even if every film/show turned out to be masterpieces. 

I really question how Marvel is going to accomplish trying it ""all"" together in a cohesive way. Now, yes, the first and easiest answer to that is that it wont and we'll be in a spiraling mess until its done and they reboot. A lot of the shows have not been exactly well received or had low viewership. However, barring that, what Im really asking: What is Marvel's intent to establishing cohesion to counter this? How does Marvel rethink their strategy on slowing output but also have like 20+ plotlines to juggle?

Like just to list out everything from Phase 4 onward:

- WandaVision leads to not only Doctor Strange 2, but Agatha and eventually Vision Quest. Their kids are major plot points, likely to be involved in some sort of YA/Ultimates group.

- F+WS will see ""most"" of its payoff with 2 movies, CA4 and Thunderbolts, but again, lays the groundwork for Eli Bradley (i.e. YA/Ultimates)

- Loki is pretty simple, since it seems inherently tied the most to Kang Dynasty out of anything save for Ant-Man

- Black Widow to Hawkeye to Thunderbolts

- Shang-Chi seems to be specifically Avengers right?

- Eternals....no idea. Arishem and that whole thing seems very unrelated to anything else cosmic. Black Knight/Dane Whitman seems to have a clearer direction I guess

- Hawkeye to Thunderbolts, but again, Kate Bishop is the main drive no? YA/Ultimates? What of Clint? Whats his next step?

- Spider-Man 3 clearly only has a lead-in to its sequel, potentially with Daredevil atm

- Doctor Strange 2 either to a sequel or Kang Dynasty. No idea about America Chaves, save for maybe YA/Ultimates?

- Moon Knight has no sign of a season 2. At a more street level, are they aiming to put him with Daredevil or do Marvel Knights? When? How?

- Ms. Marvel has a clear direction, like Wanda The Marvels, but then again, what? YA/Ultimates?

- Thor seems to solely be to the next Avengers outing I'd assume.

- She-Hulk, like the above, has no season 2 signs, so....Avengers next?

- WWBN....no idea

- Black Panther 2, like DS2 or Thor 4, seem very isolated so a sequel or Avengers


- Ant-Man is obvious, but also Cassie, potentially being another YA/Ultimates lead in

- Guardians 3: More of an ending but Star Lord is on Earth currently so probably Avengers on his own for now.

- Secret Invasion is a lead in to The Marvels, and evidently Armor Wars...but now something else with Sonya and G'iah.


And this is just what we have and what we know. The following projects are only laid out to 2026/2027 at this point:

- Loki S2
- Echo
- The Marvels
- Ironheart
- Agatha
- Captain America 4
- Deadpool 3
- Thunderbolts
- Daredevil
- Blade
- Armor Wars 
- Spider-Man 4
- Wonder Man
- Vision Quest
- Nova (was reported as a show but nobody attached to it)
- Fantastic 4
- Both Avengers films


Does this lineup establish cohesion at this point? Can the Avengers films do 30+ characters justice since many of these shows do not have season 2's currently.  Even successful films like Shang-Chi do not currently have sequels in direct development (its director is doing Wonder Man and an Avengers film). Theres currently no ""reported"" YA/Ultimates project, Midnight Sons, Marvel Knights, Illuminati to help offset this kind of inflation on characters, there be? Maybe Daredevil will have far more crossovers than we think (i.e. Moon Knight, She-Hulk, Echo etc)? We already know Punisher is there. Is that another project spun off too?

Its just.....crazy, and I cannot see how some of these characters or projects will not see resolutions to some storylines for 5-10 years, even with the ensemble sequels like The Marvels that push forward 3+ character plotlines, let alone a popular character not getting a justified project for years for the same reasons (i.e. too much going on).

Marvel is in such a weird position right now, and Im curious if they have an active solution to really pushing characters forward without waiting 5+ years between most (some like Wanda, Yelena, Sam, Bucky, or Kamala are lucky, but definitely not Shang-Chi or Moon Knight or She-Hulk currently)"

WandaVision is a unique show and I love the sitcom elements it had. 

We were confused at the beginning and cried at the end of it.

We got to see Wanda grew and try to become better (Until MoM messed it up)

Sure there's MCU shows like Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Loki, Agents of Shield but WandaVision has a special place for me that show was phenomenal and I wish I could erase my memory so I can watch it all over again and again."

Agents of Shield managed to run a whole of 7 seasons even with the threat of cancellation, staying a overall consistent quality and ending strong. Not to mention it's excellent writing and characters, the fact that it did multiple concepts before the larger MCU, and did it better (time travel, what if storyline, Wanda visions themed intros , shapeshifters and ""who can you trust"" storylines  etc) or the fact that it does great worldbuilding for the larger MCU. And the creators and writers behind it actually care about the source material and the comics and honoring them (unlike the Secret invasion director/writer who didn't even read the comic).

Because something that really annoyes me is the fact that when AOS originally was airing, people were shitting on the show, saying that it didnt connect enough to the movies, and nobody in the movies referenced it, so it wasnt canon, and that when the Disney plus shows came out we would finally get some proper Marvel tv content, that was actually good and high quality like the movies and connected and had consequences to the larger MCU, but then what happened is that, not only is AOS a better tv show then most, if not all the Disney plus shows so far, it also has the most references and interconnectivety to the larger MCU then most of them, and the Disney plus shows feel largely disconnected or inconsequensal to the larger MCU, with no movie referencing them (besides loki i guess, and wandavison sort of, but then the writer for MOM didnt even watch Wandavision or care about it, so case and point). So I think it's time to look back and realize that we had it good back in the day, with AOS and Daredevil on Netflix etc, and that these Disney plus shows ain't the end all be all of quality marvel content on our tv screens, and that AOS especially should be respected for what it is and what it achieved."

Now, we've seen Sonya doing a much better job at dealing with the Skrulls than Nick did, by capturing and torturing one for information, discovering her boss was a Skrull, capturing the scientists behind the super skrull lab, taking all of their research, torching the place, and killing one of them, all without batting an eye or feeling old and grumpy about it, and G'iah is of course a super duper ultra Skrull now. So it does seem plausible that they could do it better.

I don't know if this was intentional or not, but the way Sonya is spitting in the face of the show's premise, which did end up being bad, is so meta, that even She-Hulk would roll her eyes."

https://variety.com/2023/tv/features/secret-invasion-director-ali-selim-season-finale-mixed-reviews-1235681998/

Some key excerpts that just left a rotten taste in my mouth along with my thoughts:

INTERVIEWER:
What have you made of the reaction to the series overall? Because reviews have been mixed.

SELIM:
""Oh, I don’t read reviews. With all due respect. For me, I view all the storytelling work I do as a dialogue with an audience. When the show is finished and put up on the screen, that’s my half of the dialogue. And the audience then starts their half of the response to it. I think that’s valuable, but I don’t know. I don’t know how to answer the question.

I don’t feel bad about mixed reviews. If you had unanimously good reviews, every movie would gross $10 billion, trillion dollars, right? [Projects] resonate with different people at different times for different reasons, and *Marvel has a very devoted — even rabid — fan base who have expectations and when their expectations aren’t fulfilled, they move in the other direction; they give it a thumbs down.*

*I don’t know — is it our job to fulfill their expectations? Or to tell the story that we’re telling? So, it’s a tricky thing.* I would love it if everybody loved it, but I also don’t have that expectation myself, so I feel great about the response to it.""

OP-
**Sir, we are rabid because most of us are adults who grew up reading these stories and are so glad we lived long enough to see them on screen. We were given amazing adaptations of what can be described as our very own mythology for years and we ate good so maybe we became accustomed to stories told with purpose and care?**

•

INTERVIEWER: 
It’s a different story than Marvel has ever really told. Let’s dive into some of the actual plot points of the finale. One of the highlights was the massive showdown between G’iah and Gravik — whose powers have been enhanced by the Avengers’ DNA. What will you remember about working with Emilia and Kingsley on that fight scene?

SELIM:
""It’s interesting — they’re both stellar actors who bring a lot of electricity and, in most instances, in very quiet ways. I’m deeply moved by some of the subtlest choices that Emilia Clarke makes. I think she could do no wrong.

When you get to a heavily choreographed fight scene or bombing sequence or an ambush sequence, it’s just kind of fun, right? It’s actors being like, “OK, I don’t have to bring it today. I just have to be a 12-year-old swinging from a rope.” So, there’s a lot of fun in those moments and there’s a lot of danger. But it’s not as emotionally significant or emotionally resonant as the quiet moment in Episode 5 where she and Nick Fury discussed Talos’ death.

*The fight sequences become mathematical, mechanical, precise. “Did we get it?” “Yes.” “Move on.” It comes together later in edit, and then you congratulate your mathematics and your mechanics; you don’t congratulate the emotional resonance.*""

OP-
**This makes me see red. Your action sequence should have heart and thought put into it, even if it is a Marvel movie. The big giant CGI fight between Cap and Tony in Civil War? Yeah, it was choreographed to death. But did your heart shatter when Tony flinched because he thinks Steve is about to murder him and instead plunged the shield into his chest plate? That's some emotional resonance I congratulate to this effing day my guy.**


I would love to hear others' insights about this because as an MCU veteran and ""rAbiD"" comic book fan, i just feel gross and dejected by the show and slate of recent content as well as the general attitude from the creative minds behind it all."
My Fanfic Rewrite of Captain Marvel,Gan-san,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dnqc4/my_fanfic_rewrite_of_captain_marvel/,1690729328.0,"I love CM and have watched it several times, but I also think it could have been much better. Mainly, I think they tried to do too much with just one movie and the Kree and Skrull conflict and world building needed more time to establish. Plus I needed more buy in with Yon-Rogg and his motivations. So… without further ado, here's how I would have done it:

We open to a backwater Kree outpost where Vers is a mundane transport pilot shuttling resources back and forth as captain of a bulk freighter. She has a jaded sidekick copilot who eventually shares her belief that Vers is destined for something greater, but doesn’t yet understand why.

Vers is plagued by dreams that give her flashes of places and events she doesn’t understand or remember. Like… being caught in an explosion, being injured and experimented on, Marvell, etc. She goes to the base doctor and explains and they tell her it is because of PTSD from the terrible freighter accident she was in and is lucky to be alive. They adjust her inhibitor, which Vers thinks is vital to her recovery and continued service as a pilot and she leaves.

As soon as she walks out, the doctor calls up Yon-Rogg and is like, “Ayo, I don’t know how long we can keep this up. Baby girl is coming around and starting to remember. I’ve had to crank her inhibitor up to near maximum, but she’s still having memories.” YR says, “Do what you can for now. I’ll handle it. She can’t know that she’s a failed experiment and can’t control her powers to our satisfaction. We haven’t found a way to do so without risk so hiding her is best for now.”

Meanwhile… Skrull attack! They try to steal some supplies causing military action nearby. Carol and her transport are called into action. During the scuffle, she shows off her piloting and leadership skills that helps save the day for the Kree. She also glows a little and channels power into her ship to perform a maneuver that should be impossible, but only her and her copilot know about her power, but everybody sees her hero move and celebrates her. 

The base Commander… who is unaware of her past and the secret of her origin, takes notice of her. He believes her talent is wasted on piloting a bulk freighter ""I’ve never seen anybody pull such a move with an old S39-Starlifter.” He arranges her to go to the Kree home world and meet the Supreme Intelligence, something YR does not want to happen for obvious reasons.

While the doctor tries to talk the base Commander out of it and is unsuccessful, they let YR know and he comes there personally to take care of Carol once and for all. At this point he has given up on ever being able to control Carol and use her power as a weapon and believes she needs to be put down. He doesn’t want the public to know the nature of Carol’s power or her origin, because to me… I don’t think all Kree are in on this.

Meanwhile, Vers and her crew are out in the boonies trying to activate her power. She shows inconsistent flashes of super strength, and fires a weak energy blast and even floats a little but she can’t do it for very long, nor is she anywhere near her full power. They decide that she keep it all secret until she meets the Supreme Intelligence.

A couple of assassination attempts fail unbeknownst to her due to her growing seventh sense and durability from YR and his elite crew who are now on station.

She reaches the home planet and sees the SI. We have a big reveal scene that confirms a lot of her dreams as reality and she is now suspicious of the Kree and their motivations as well as what she has been told about herself, but she isn’t quite ready for mutiny/treason yet and she still thinks Skrulls are bad.

YR introduces himself and begrudgingly allows her to join his unit as pilot of a dropship due to political pressure. She still thinks she is being sandbagged but is glad to be on the front lines and part of such a prestigious unit.

YR sabotages her ship and has it rigged to explode when everyone else has disembarked but before they can execute the plan… the Skrulls Attack! Now the part where they are going to rescue the spy in the movie can happen, except YR and Minn-erva or whoever are arguing whether or not they can try to kill Carol again during such an important mission.
Chaos breaks loose, the Skrulls start kicking ass and Carol has to come flying in to save the day again. Her efforts to empower the ship causes it to explode and crash. She survives but is stunned a little and left dazed and in the middle of the conflict. 

She fights off a whole bunch of Skrulls and saves a bunch of Kree with normal fighting skills and slightly enhanced strength but is eventually subdued and captured.

…and here we can pick up where she is captive aboard the Skrull ship and they are trying to extract the info from her memory. Here we get a full flashback of her being a human military pilot, her friendship with Monica, her being taken under Mar-vell’s wing, all that needs to be fleshed out more, but to me, this would give Carol the “learning her power” scene and also make YR’s motivation more credible and consistent IMO."
Steve Coulter (Holden Holliway) and Drew Matthews (Dennis Bukowski) were added the stylized closing credits of She-Hulk's earlier episodes after release.,MovieLover0,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15cu7p4/steve_coulter_holden_holliway_and_drew_matthews/,1690642349.0,"&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Disney altered certain She-Hulk episodes to move the names of Coulter and Matthews from one credits spot to another after the episodes' initial release.**

I’ve recently begun rewatching She-Hulk, and I noticed something odd while watching the first episode’s stylized closing credits. For many D+ MCU shows (and for many modern shows and miniseries in general), these closing credits are used to highlight key members of the production staff (director, writer, producer, etc.) and cast members with “Starring” / “Series Regular” or “Special Guest Star” status. Secret Invasion, interestingly, featured stylized opening credits, with its special guest stars relegated to the standard closing text credits (likely to avoid spoiling certain appearances).

While there are a lot of contractual- and experience-related factors that affect the credit an actor receives on any show or movie (think of the list of special credits during Endgame’s end credits), some of the D+ shows’ crediting choices seemed weird to me in the past. Josh Stamberg (Tyler Hayward), for instance, was credited as a guest star despite appearing in six of WandaVision’s nine episodes and playing a significant role in the series’ plot. Eugene Cordero (Casey / Hunter K-5E) was credited in the closing credits - alongside other starring actors - for the three episodes of Loki that he appeared in, but was later reported to [have been promoted to series regular status](https://deadline.com/2022/09/loki-eugene-cordero-upped-series-regular-season-2-1235122473/) for the show’s second season, despite already having been in the credits.

Even being aware of these examples (and many more across the industry in general) while watching She-Hulk for the first time, it struck me as odd that Steve Coulter (Holden Holliway) wasn’t initially credited in She-Hulk’s closing credits alongside the show’s other key characters. At the time, this could have been simply explained by him just not receiving the starring status in his contract - until he was suddenly added to the stylized credits in the show’s eighth episode. This was also seen with Drew Matthews (Dennis Bukowski), who had a smaller role in She-Hulk’s first three episodes, but was added to the stylized credits following a brief appearance in its ninth episode.

Both Coulter and Matthews were credited as “Guest Stars” in the earlier episodes of She-Hulk that they appeared in. This is nothing new in the world of tv - actors would get promoted to starring status mid-season regularly during the height of broadcast tv. This even happened in the realm of Marvel, as Adrainne Palicki (Bobbi Morse) was [upgraded to starring status](https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/agents-of-shield-promotes-adrianne-palicki-to-series-regular-1201434285/) midway through Agents of Shield’s second season, after previously making multiple guest appearances.

So imagine my surprise when I began rewatching She-Hulk and noticed that the names of both Coulter and Matthews appeared in the first episode’s stylized closing credits. I thought to myself, “That wasn’t there before, right?”, and immediately opened Youtube to see if anyone had uploaded the credits upon the episode’s release last year. Thankfully, [someone had](https://youtu.be/iBwLLhvZ334) \- and sure enough, the names of Coulter and Matthews weren’t there. Looking at the following episodes, both actors now appear in the stylized credits of She-Hulk’s second and third episodes, with Coulter’s name also appearing solo in the credits of episode five.

**So at some point after release, Disney altered certain She-Hulk episodes to move the names of Coulter and Matthews from one credits spot to another** (and maybe other aspects of the episodes were changed too). I couldn’t find any other discussion about this random, small fact online, so I figured I’d bring it up here (with a somewhat long post, sorry!). What do you think? Did the contracts of Coulter and Matthews change after She-Hulk started airing?

I hope you find this interesting!"

I decided to take a few hours to make this post to see if someone had the same impressions I had after the finale. I'm not a critic, or an expert, just a 25 year old dude with a passion for writing, modern problems and cinema, among other things. *I apologize in advance for my possible errors in the text,  I'm not a native speaker. Sorry for the long read*

I think we are all aware of the protests going on in the Hollywood industry these days. And I think this series has all the problems that the employees of the industry itself complain about.

I'm not just talking about using the AI for the opening, but the obvious problems in the plot, or at least, *to the plot we saw in this final montage.*

# As any of you noticed how the first two episodes seems to have been written with a completely different idea of what the rest of the episodes had to be?

***- ALERT: MAJOR SECRET INVASION SPOILERS AHEAD -***

I imagine you all remember how those took it slow, showing us more introspection in the characters, gave them and to the story time to breathe, presenting Gravik as a vengeful mastermind that immediately kills Fury long time partner. It looked to be a spy story somewhat, like what we got in Cap movies and I was really excited.

Then after the 3rd the episodes' length starts to reduce, and some of the foundations laid by episodes 1-2 seems to have been completely forgotten:

* For example, what was the point of showing us how Gravik took the command at the ""Secret Skrull Summit"", when we never seen those skrulls with important roles in the human society do something to help him after that episode?
* ***Why so many plotlines and conflicts started to open and then close that fast with no proper resolution?*** In the 4th episode we saw Talos die the day after him and Fury had a whole conversation about how Fury needed him. I was expecting to see, at least by the end of the series, Nick to take time to pay or to show some respect to his old friend, to close the circle, maybe admitting that he wouldn't have made it without his sacrifice. But Talos' death seems only to complicate things even more and all his efforts are wasted by Fury's actions in the last episode
* **what was the point of showing us the mutiny of the rebel skrulls against Gravik if you then have them all die offscreen?** For once when Talos was going to be right. Talos had told G'iah that by helping the humans against the rebel skrulls they would earn their gratitude. That was his plan to resolve his people's problem and also what seems to happen after news reports show how he, an alien, sacrificed while saving the President ... only to blow it all in the finale when that idiot declares war to all the aliens on Earth. Because you know, they just remembered they need a plot for Avengers Secret Wars
* **Oh yeah, about the declaration fo war: does this include Asgardians too?** Because, those are aliens too, mr. President
* Don't even get me started about all those **humans the skrull replaced coming out of the area, helped by the military, with zero radiation sickness**. And in case you are going to say that: *No, Iodium pills don't act like a magical barrier from radioactivity*. They just protect your thyroid from it and only on a small scale

I'm really starting to think the director is lying in the interwiews. How can you justificate similar plot holes with stuff like *""it was too long""*? He can't really believe in this.

To me it looks like that they where forced to change the script. So, **they asked to the people who had to connect the plot of the cutted sections of the show to do it too fast**. And in the end, the final result lacks a lot of explainations and shows major continuity errors.

And that's why we end up with such plot holes or discutible plot solutions, like the DNA of 30 or more superhumans all stored inside a single vial that suddenly becomes the McGuffin of the show after 4 episodes. Also, why implanting an alien DNA should give you magic powers? Aren't those learned only with training and meditation? Why G'iah shows to have Ghost's powers? She wasn't in the last battle, why the hell there was Ghost's DNA inside it? I better stop here

# Ultimately we got cool spy story ending with a CGI wrestling match that had nothing to do with the first episodes' premise

The only thing that came out to be good written in this series is **the relationship between Fury and Vara**. But that wasn't meant to be the main problem Fury had to face here. Instead, **with this montage, we get the impression Fury prefered to save his marriage instead of maintaining the promise he made to his friend Talos and the skrulls**. Which is ... Understandable and underwhelming at the same time.

**I would have definitely preferred if this series had been the swan song of Samuel L. Jackson's character.** I honestly would have liked more an ending where it was Fury to take the powers, who then fought Gravik to the last breath in an emotinal fight against the orphan he turned into a monster, and then dying for the radiation after saving all of the others, while G'iah should have been the one to kill the false Rodhey in front of the president, to show him not all skrulls are terrorists, and to fullfill her dad's plan of earning one of the humanity's most important pearson's gratitude.

Instead, **we got a series who's sole purpose is to create another unecessarly powerful character and to set the foundations for the next Avengers movie.**

It seems that Fury has involuted instead of evolved, and has lost a lot of the charisma it had and I don't see a real reason to keep him around in the francise with this ending"
"If you’d like to feel some optimism after Secret Invasion, watch Netflix’s ‘Beef’ (for MCU related reasons)",StrawHatRat,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15cpxag/if_youd_like_to_feel_some_optimism_after_secret/,1690629876.0,"Between the final two episodes of Secret Invasion, I started and finished ‘Beef’ a recent Netflix original. It’s an awesome show, it’s got excellent characters and is so full of twists and turns. 

The reason I say it will make you feel optimistic is, it’s largely directed by Jake Schreier, the director of the upcoming Thunderbolts film, and it’s created/written by Lee Sung Jin, who is one of the writers of Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts is also written by Eric Pearson, who is credited as the writer of Thor Ragnarok, who’s also a welcome face in my opinion. 

I know Secret Invasion was written in part by the writer of iRobot, but having a successful writer/director duo on the film has me pretty optimistic.

Sound familiar?

Obviously it was done as a meta joke but what’s ironic is that they essentially go on to do the same type of thing with Secret Invasion and The Harvest. 

I could add wood to fire and give an essay about the problems I think that Secret Invasion had, but one of the biggest I think is the fact that the ending did not satisfy any major character plots that they started and the led the show with, and chose to satisfy this “event” with a plot line they threw together with the last two episodes. 

Marvel ”TV” as a whole has had its hits and misses imo and has not all been bad, but with the agenda of pushing quality over quantity now, I hope they can take the chance to review where they fell short in whatever arenas and move forward."
Barbenheimer shows auteurs MUST take over the MCU.,Bruhmangoddman,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15dsoon/barbenheimer_shows_auteurs_must_take_over_the_mcu/,1690741909.0,"Forgive the bold phrasing, the point had to be made.

&amp;#x200B;

So I am just past watching the Barbenheimer juggernaut and oh lordy, what a package. Both films are certainly expertly crafted, immensely well acted and thoroughly well thought out. 

Something that, well... Hasn't been really the case in the MCU.

My lack of access to Disney+ aside, I didn't even need to see the entirety of Secret Invasion to get enough information to be appalled by some of the choices. The bullshit Harvest device - how the fuck do you actually get this much superpowered DNA - grey CGI bullshit I saw in video clips of the finale, Gravik allegedly being a generic bad guy... Yeah, I don't think I'm seeing it again. 

I also never saw Eternals. Shang-Chi was aggressively meh. Black Widow - merely decent. And while I admire GOTG 3, Love and Thunder, MOM and No Way Home, the only reason they're as good is their handling by auteurs. Jon Watts aside, I think it's clear the directors of the 4 are auteurs with unmistakable style - Gunn, Raimi, Waititi. The emotion, the style, the flair is conveyed in different manners, but it hits and captivates all the same.

And now Barbenheimer. A double whammy of grand proportions, each of the project helmed by an experienced auteur filmmaker. While I have no experience with Gerwig outside Barbie, Nolan has endeared me long since Batman Begins. And here he is no different. Both Barbie and Oppenheimer are so full of artistry, style and atmosphere it's hard not to be amazed.

That's how Marvel survives. Let the auteurs take reigns, push the MCU in directions never seen, STYLIZE THE SHIT OUT OF IT (it's comic books, guys!), and be bold. 

Hell, Zack Snyder could make a very good movie for Marvel. Or at least one risky enough to satisfy those who believe MCU's playing it too safe.

I really hope Nia DaCosta and Julius Omah are at least somewhat auteurish, because I think I'll nope out of this universe after The Marvels and Brave New World. It'd be sad to end this 12 year journey (for me) with a whimper."

* Never teased in previous 30+ movies
* Just straight up retconned so after seeing most of the universe suddenly we have to believe ""btw, not that far from Earth there is this alien civilization, that have also frequently visited Earth for previous thousands of Earth! Why didn't nobody knew about this earlier? Don't ask""
* Interaction with already established characters to connect the universe? No, meet 20 new characters
* Thor don't really notice any events happening in previous years, he may throw one line about how ""he missed his brother during, what do you call it? The blip""
* Suddenly this big, huuuge threat to the entire ~~Earth~~ ~~Universe~~ Multiverse emerge, and Thor has to stop it alone! Where are the Avengers? We don't really know who the Avengers are now. Anybody else? Nope. And there are 15 more movies planned so of course the threat is stopped without any consequences really
* Quick tease of Beta Ray Bill at the end! Next Thor movie will probably drop in 5 years, because of how much other movies/series is made, and Beta Ray Bill will not show up in any of them, so you have to wait. Actually, during all this time plans for the sequel may change, so he may not show up in it also. Even the possibility of a sequel is not so certain

Eternals as Phase 1 movie:

* Teased at the end of previous movie
* Introduced few characters, not too much, the most important thing is you have to get to know new characters, like them, see chemistry between them
* Mostly showing another big part of MCU, yet unexplored, important to the future of franchise, in a way that is believable
* The threat is big... for our heroes. But it won't destroy the planet. Also there aren't many heroes around and there is no time, they may be busy with something more important anyway. But because we are engaged in the story, smaller threat feels very big to us
* Teasing first Avengers movie at the end, that will drop in just one year

&amp;#x200B;

It isn't really a jab at Eternals specifically, more like entire phase 4/5 so far. And at all those posts saying that phase 1-2 movies were universally liked without any reason, and newer movies are universally hated for no reason, because I don't agree with that.

I don’t buy it. The pacing has been stilted and awkward since the very beginning. The writing uninspired. 

The finale was exactly as mediocre as the rest of the series suggested it would be, and I almost think a certain subset of people are just using it as an excuse to about-face on their positive initial reactions to the show."

Even the better shows like Wandavision and Loki had a lot of filler. The Marvel movies feel very well balanced with action, drama, jokes whereas the shows really drag. Long format content really lives or dies on the quality of the dialogue, because you cant have non stop action (Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men etc). The dialogue heavy scenes in the Marvel shows just aren’t good enough to justify the extra length. I love Daredevil but even that was a bit a slog in the middle of each season, so 18 eps worries me."

Just look at the front page of this subreddit. I understand that a lot of people found Secret Invasion underwhelming. There are very real criticisms you can justifiably level at Secret Invasion.

My concern is that **we ate too well for too long**. Our perspective has become skewed. Thanks to the nature of social media, we are prone to hyperbole. *Everything* we find mildly disappointing is now ""The Worst"". 

Yes. Secret Invasion was a disappointment *compared to other MCU entries*. But it was still better than 80% of Netflix's entire catalog. 

Again, there are *legitimate* criticisms of Secret Invasion and Phase 4 in general. Personally, I believe the lack of goalposts in Phase 4 really hurt the MCU.

I'm a big fan of Star Wars but I can't even stomach the negativity in their subreddit anymore. I'm an even bigger Marvel fan and I really don't want that to happen here.

I purposed the idea of Frank (the punisher) would use a modified .50cal bullet with a vibranium or adamantium tip there's no way it wouldn't go through his skin inevitably killing him!

Now what about the Avengers? He's not even in that, not even a cameo? In Age of Ultron, he appears but again he's missing for a majority of the film. Would have been nice to have a scene explaining he's putting out potential dangers elsewhere in the world while the Avengers are doing their thing.

His appearance in Civil War went well imo and I liked the addition of his injury but wish they'd have brought more attention to it in Infinity War and Endgame. Heck, the story idea of him being Vice President in Endgame is something the Russos should have gone with.

And now the reveal in Secret Invasion, does anyone know what they're doing with Rhodey?

Is it the blame of the writers? Is it just that Don Cheadle was filming other movies/series so they wrote him less to do? Have the producers been the cause of this?"

If so, wouldn't they have found out about the Skrulls beforehand? How would the machines have been keeping the victims in their stasis if certain skrulls were blipped?

Then our new actual avengers will catch wind of this and go after them, maybe fighting different kang variants along the way.

I would even say it was revolting in term of storytelling. Allow me to rant because I actually care about this universe and good TV shows.

- Finishing the show on a superhero fight. Why ? Forgetting the fight was not even fun to watch, this is an espionage TV show, they couldn’t come up with something better ? No big spy reveal ? A CGI soup ?

- A good part of the appeal was that Fury has to deal with the invasion without using superheroes because he’s smart and feels responsible, why does he change his mind on the last episode ? What was the point of not calling Cpt Marvel before if he’s fine having G’iah deal with Gravik ?

- G’iah and Fury’s plan made no sense if you think about more than 2 seconds. There was near zero chance Gravik would let Fury walk up to the machine. Him being a skrull was sooo obvious. High chance of him getting the powers and w they could not stop him.  But somehow Gravik develops a temperature room IQ in the last episode, and gets killed. No character development for him. 

- Fury caused all of this trouble by making a promise to Skrulls that he could not keep, and this weights on him through the show. But on the last episode he decided to not care anymore. War on Skrulls ? People getting killed ? Oh well there’s peace talk with the Kree, I’m out of this b*****. 

- As people pointed out, there was more tension in the final montage were we see things go to sh*t and people /skrull getting killed. I wish the final episode was about that instead !

I have more but I’ll leave it there.

TLDR; the last episode feels completely disconnected from the rest of the show narratively speaking, sh*tting on everything that was built on."

Hell, Marvel Netflix figured it out with The Defenders limited series. 

It was exciting to see everyone mingle with one another even if it feels janky (the story dragged it down with the Hand/Black Sky thing/ Dragon thing)

Secret Invasion should've been that ""Avengers""-y series. Gather most characters that exclusively appeared in the Disney+ shows and have them cameo in SI. Start the series mid-search, Hill investigating the recent 'terrorist' attacks from the shows, from the alleged hostage-taking in Westview, to the Flagsmashers, to the countless deaths in Egypt (Moon Knight). Hill and Ross are undercover (same as the first episode,) include Agent Prescod more, instead of an expository setting, there will be allusions that Skrulls were snooping in on official/classified Avengers-level threat. Then, boom, FFH gets referenced as Skrulls mishandling the situation, Hayward is questioned if he's a normal human or something else...  They (Hill, Ross, Prescod) reconvene from the shady Agent Carter/Powerbroker... 

Include a refined version of Project Insight, one that monitors sudden spikes in socio-normative behavior, then we get an asshole Jake cameo, where they both suspect each other but with different ideas of ""shifting""... Say a throwaway line about the ""school raid"" and ""light shows"" somewhere in New Jersey and Hill will say that Gravik's Skrull faction doesn't fit the New Jersey shenanigans; Prescod remarks about ""the Rockefeller tree, wasn't Barton on that?"" to which Hill replied with, those were the Tracksuit Mafia, those aren't even on Gravik's radar"". Ms. Marvel and Hawkeye gets a nod while expanding on Gravik's M.O.; Gravik targets agents and people in high power, since they were trained by Fury on spy craft, there is literally no one that can be trusted, not even these three...

All in all, there are a lot more that you can sprinkle in it... A sympathetic and patient Skrull (preferably the Skrull Monica encountered at the end of Wandavision) that understands the plight of searching a planet, and settled and adjusts herself, and even made a name for herself as an Agent of S.W.O.R.D.; include a funny cameo as they watch She-hulk and her many, many TV appearances, and someone like Ross would say, ""Is she a Skrull, too?"" (Corny, i know)

I'm sorry to rain on anyones parade. I truly liked Secret Invasion, the fight scene was awesome, the intrigue and in-fighting from the Skrulls was grea,, but the opportunity to have the first live-action Disney Plus show not named after a superhero be this... was a huge waste of opportunity. I wish more threads were answered (written above)

It shouldn't be Fury's last hurrah, it should've been Fury out of touch in the world that he created out of the kindness of his heart. Hell is paved with good intentions, y'know. Maximum of ten episodes, with proper twists and sendoffs for characters that'll appear.

Why is it so easy to permanently dispose of Deadpool?,dean_dbn,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15cq92e/why_is_it_so_easy_to_permanently_dispose_of/,1690630978.0,"Now I understand that so long as Deadpool's regeneration isn't nullified he is techniquelly invincible, but the fact is that any villain with a small amount of money could easily dispose of Deadpool long enough for it to be permanent. Let me explain.

The sure fire way to dispose of Deadpool would to be to construct a container that can hold a human head. The container should be comprised of two layers, the inside must be a thick wall of glass, and the outside must be a strong metal such as Tungsten or Titanium. The container must also be able to be permanently shut and be air-tight.

Next you would need to dig a hole roughly 8 to 10 feet downwards, preferably somewhere isolated so that it wont be found. Now you need to consider what you're going to fill the hole in with. You could very well use the same dirt you dug out, however a more effective option would be to make a layer of concrete at the bottom, leaving room for the box and for concrete to be poured around the box, sealing it in. If you did choose to use concrete, you would only need enough to encase the box itself, the rest of the hole can be filled in with dirt. Also, to make the concrete more effective, you could add some steel parts (such as nails, nuts and bolts) to make a stronger composite. Again, dirt would be fine. After the hole is made you need to aquire enough sulfuric acid to fill the container.

Once you have the box and the hole ready, the only thing you would need to do is remove Deadpool's head and get away. This might not be the easiest step, but considering that he has no other abilities aside from regeneration, it shouldn't be too hard.

Once you have the head, bring the box and head to the hole. Place the head in the box, ignoring the nonsense and sarcastic jokes it's saying to you in the process, and fill the container until it's just full enough that you can still shut the box. Then shut the box and seal it permanently. Place the box at the bottom of the hole, and if you did opt for the concrete approach, surround the sealed box in concrete (or the concrete composite). Fill the rest of the hole in and there you have it.

The glass layer of the box will prevent the acid from corroding the box, and the outer metallic layer will ensure the box is unharmed by any external activity. The acid will keep the head from regenerating too much and will keep the head at such a minimal level for long enough that by the time the acid is no longer effective, or is inactive, that no matter what he will never be able to escape by himself.

The metal will ensure that regeneration never gets too advanced by keeping it in a very small area. And the concrete ensures that the metal is unable to bend or expand from internal pressure and will ensure no air can reach the metal, plus no one will be able to hear any potential screaming.

If all steps are followed correctly and no one knew the plan or location, we can be sure that Deadpool is permanently disposed of. Why is it so easy, and further more, why is it so relatively cheap? Also, WHY has no one thought of this?

Update: I know that transporting the head from the beheading location to retrieving the box and then arriving at the hole may be a bit of a nuissance, but so long as you don't mind severring some growing baby parts, you would be fine. Also, you may need some tape to keep him quiet along the journey."
What do you guy want to see in Vision Quest? (Poster by me),BenSolo_Cup,55,https://i.redd.it/9w9wfpirbpeb1.jpg,1690548207.0,I’m actually really excited for this series because it seems like it’s gonna be a semi-sequel to WandaVision which was arguably marvels best show so far! I’m hoping that they bring back Ultron as the villain and maybe start to set up the Young Avengers a bit further.

Marvel needs to stop putting end-of-the-world level stakes in every single one of their stories.,MicrowaveBurrito2568,6628,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15az6ix/marvel_needs_to_stop_putting_endoftheworld_level/,1690456726.0,"It feels like every single story that the MCU makes, there’s always some threat that is threatening to end the world or universe. That immediately makes the story less engaging. Obviously Gravik is not going to kill all humans because we have 30+ more projects coming out in the future. Obviously Scarlet Witch is not gonna kill the entire multiverse when we have dozens of projects announced for the future. 

It’s just a boring conflict when every villain is trying to destroy the world for barely any reason. Imagine if the story for Doctor Strange 2 was Dr Strange trying to stop Wanda from killing her alternate self and taking her place. It becomes a  more personal movie and the possibility of Wanda actually winning is much greater and makes the audience feel more engaged and tense like the characters in the story.

Imagine if Gravik simply wanted to kill Talos and other high ranking Skrulls to become the new leader. The story instantly becomes more small scale and the audience is unsure whether he will fail or actually succeed and take over the Skrulls for future projects.

I don’t get why every story from Black Widow to Eternals to Love and Thunder to Wakanda Forever to Moon Knight to Secret Invasion needs to have world or universe altering stakes. Let some of these shows and movies be small scale like Hawkeye or She-Hulk. It’s much better that way."

I love the character, and it would be great to have a movie that goes into his backstory with his parents in Latveria, what made him leave and eventually introduce him and us to the new Fantastic Four. Given he is such a major character and the F4 intros have been done to death it would be amazing and could set him up as the next big villain potentially."

Which is mostly fine as an idea, because it for the most part addresses the inevitable question of where mutants have been throughout history if they started making wide-spread appearances in the mid-20th century as they did in the normal Marvel universe. I think. I'm very much not caught up on X-Men, so feel free to correct me there.


In any event, the problem is Professor X and Magneto. Their character archetypes are defined by them being older, more experienced mutants that have had their powers for decades and are, in their own ways, seeking to guide younger and less experienced mutants as more and more arise. How will this work in the MCU? 


And as for Magneto specifically, World War II ended almost 80 years ago, so I feel like it's going to get harder and harder to make him being a Holocaust survivor believable. On the one hand, the Holocaust is a very well-known atrocity and one that easily informs his character and motivations. Even if there is another, more recent atrocity that could be used instead, would it still have the same impact? And morally speaking, because of how serious an issue the Holocaust is, would it even be right to change that part of his backstory? I'm really not sure, and I'm curious to see what everyone here thinks about these questions, as well as what Marvel ultimately decides to do."

-they spend the first three episodes telling us nick fury’s not the same anymore, and by the end of the series nothing happens to show us that he’s back;

-they still didn’t give a good enough excuse as to why they don’t just call the damn avengers;

-talos’ death feels like it has no repercussions, apart from giving g’iah the single “you killed my father” line;

-skrull rhodes is so cartoonishly evil it makes the president look even fucking stupider for not figuring out something’s wrong with him;

-fury never even GETS a final confrontation with gravik (you know, the whole point the show has been building towards) and instead walks into a hospital and shoots a few guards—and that’s supposed to be his big moment? after five episodes of buildup, that’s the big “nick fury is back” moment?;

-g’iah could solo every single confrontation that happens in the MCU from now on;

-the last ten minutes of the show, from when the presidents declares war on the skrull onwards, are so much more interesting than the entire six episodes it’s honestly ridiculous. THAT should’ve been the show. it’s what we were told it would be: a spy thriller where no one knows who’s who. it’s genuinely insane how boring and uninspired what we got is. and mark my words, they’re never gonna bring up what happened in this series (maybe as a passing mention in the marvels or captain america) until they make like, a season 2, that’s actually gonna be about the interesting conflict they set up;

-a spy thriller ending in a big cgi battle between two aliens feels so out of place it’s honestly hilarious;

-the character writing and direction felt incredibly uninspired.

if i had to mention something i found good, it’d definitely be the various conversations between fury and his wife—especially the one before they shoot each other. that felt well paced, well written, and well executed. i have no idea what happened to the rest of the show.

edit: some comments have reminded me—olivia coleman was another small highlight. her character felt interesting and fresh, and she honestly reminded me of how i felt about nick fury when _he_ was first introduced. he was mysterious, in control, and you never knew what he was working towards. hope we see more of her."

Considering how they are portrayed on excessive force to apprehend enhanced individuals the real objective of Damage Control would have been to obtain DNA that could benefit the Skrulls. Maybe their involvement on Far From Home, She-Hulk, Ms.Marvel is a setup for not only how the Skrulls have collected DNA from important individuals but that with them out of the picture, now those DNA samples are out there in the world maybe in some of the black markets showed on Falcon and the Winter Soldier.

That was what made Marvel movies stand out among the rest in the early days. Not just coherent plots but action scenes as well.

SPECIALLY the action scenes.

Fight scenes that wouldn't leave me thinking ""but why didn't he just blast his head off just now?"". At least until Strange came in and I'd think ""why didn't he solve all his problems with portal amputations?""

Still, the Infinity Saga is watertight compared to the recent stream of movies and shows.

MCU is descending to the same level of pre-MCU super hero movies. It's like super hero movies have become so ordinary they don't try anymore. Just throw in $200 million and some star power, write it like garbage Netflix stream fodder.

"Positive things about ""Secret Invasion"" (seriously)",AtlasShrunked,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ctmg5/positive_things_about_secret_invasion_seriously/,1690640773.0,"And there WERE positives sprinkled in there... intermittently:

*They left the MCU in a better, more interesting place.* The fallout of the world learning about shape-shifting aliens &amp; declaring war on 'em has great potential: Since humans &amp; Kree now have a common enemy, perhaps an alliance could be formed? Or whatever. It raises the stakes in a cool way &amp; helps set the stage for intergalactic adventures/shenanigans. 

*More interest now in Thunderbolts AND Capt. America.* Ross being the next President now has a compelling narrative: He's a war-time President in a nation that just jettisoned their ex-leader &amp; is searching for a certain kind of star-spangled sensibilities. Harrison Ford could be AMAZING at this (assuming he's motivated/gives a shit). Ford is legendary at playing the rogue who's dealing with everything falling apart. This adds a different kind of element &amp; nuance than just bad-guy-being-bad or the more-power-for-me-guy. Handled right, could be Fordtastic. 

*It's freaking content &amp; the football season hasn't begun yet.* It's crazy hot out there so instead of being outside, this is something to watch. I'd rather have MCU content than NO content. Might've been a light snack but it was still kinda tasty. If SI was a food, it'd be Pringle's, but in one of their lesser flavors.

*Sonya Falsworth is the best new character in the MCU since... well, since at least Madisyn with a Y but not where you think.* Love her. Already more compelling than Elaine from Seinfeld... and honestly, seemed a LOT brighter than Fury. She out-Fury'd Fury. Hope she has a long MCU career of superhero shoulder-rubbing &amp; espionage. 

*It's now MCU cannon that earth men have sex with green women than any other color.* I think it's an allegory for Disney &amp; money, but maybe I ate too many brownies.

*Since all the Harvest's DNA is now in G'ia... this means it's in HER blood/DNA too, right?* So theoretically, Todd just needs to date her. (Or steal the Super Skrull that she killed.) In retrospect, it's pretty bizarre that Kevin F. (presumably) oversaw both story's plot development, but never voiced a concern that She-Hulk predicted/parodied SI? Giving 'em the benefit of doubt, look forward to seeing how they resolve these loose ends.

*We will still have the man-out-of-time motif.* Cheadle is a great actor, and he was being kinda wasted as ""the best friend"" and/or ""military guy.""  The man-out-of-time motif has almost always been part of Capt. America's identity, and now post-Evans, Cheadle has the acting chops to take it in a cool, new direction, especially in a world where he missed out on a century's worth of changes (Thanos, aliens, dead Tony, yada) in his long sleep."

I feel nothing from the series and I felt as though it was a waste of time watching it. Especially with scoopers now saying that Secret Invasion may not get referenced in The Marvels or Brave New World… then what was the point of this series? 



It’s even funnier when you consider how the She-Hulk finale makes a joke about stealing blood to make a bad guy (which is the last show before Secret Invasion) and that’s literally what the SI finale was about ☠️. 



I hope Loki S2 is a big hit but Secret Invasion really hurt Marvel. I feel as though most fans either turned away from shows altogether or casuals just completely gave up on the shows now.

I've been disappointed by Marvel shows before. But I've never been so frustrated with a show since Secret Invasion. Just wanted to add my complaints to the pile.,thewalkingfred,199,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bkjps/ive_been_disappointed_by_marvel_shows_before_but/,1690510252.0,"First off...its just a shame how mishandled the telling of the source material comic was. I'm not gonna say I'm an expert on it, but I did read it back in the day and I really liked it. It was a very unique crossover event that strongly invoked paranoia unlike basically every other major event arc.

So it's just a shame they screwed it up from that perspective. You got Sam Jackson, Don Cheadle, Ben Mendelson, Emelia Clarke. You coulda done some awesome stuff with that talent.

But thats just the disappointing part.

What actually kind made me angry was how this show basically dangles a fun premise in front of your face. Samuel Fucking Jackson is gonna STAR in a paranoia filled ""invasion of the body snatchers"" spy thriller. We've never really gotten too much Nick Fury action in these films. It will be so cool seeing him do spy stuff and uncover plots and scheme. Right? Right?

But we get almost none of that all show until the finale finally teases the story we wanted to see the whole damn time. When the president like declares war on aliens and starts a big paranoid frenzy to find the enemies hiding among us. 

THATS WHAT THE SHOW WAS SUPPOSED TO BE! You can't promise a show and then give us something entirely different for 6 episodes before teasing that maybe if we tune in next time we will get the thing we wanted to see.

And to top it off, the finale of this show is literally the type of ending She Hulk made fun of in that shows finale. Down to the vials of blood that give people powers. So not only do they not give us the show they know we want, they intentionally do the ending that they know we hate! 

And one more thing. We get so many weird and unanswered questions about Nick Fury that it just leaves me feeling like we know the character even less now. We were excited to see more Sam Jackson Nick Fury and learn about what hes been up to. But instead we get almost nothing except that he married a Skrull, while actively using the Skrull refugees to murder people while not finding them a home for 30 fucking years? Hows that make any sense? His wife doesn't mind him using her race as a tool? He doesnt mind using his wifes race as a tool? Who knows?

It's just kind of astonishing to me. Ultimately this show was a colossal waste of talent, a waste of good source material, and almost feels like false advertising."
Please stop playing into the narrative that Marvel needs to make less to make better shows.,saibjai,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bzlho/please_stop_playing_into_the_narrative_that/,1690555823.0,"I paid for my Disney plus subscription. The only real Marvel ""exclusive"" content I get for 2023 is SEcret invasion, and loki 2. Everything else is a ""maybe"". All the movies that will appear here, I probably will have seen in the theatres because I am a Fan. Even then, I am just getting GOTG3, Quantumania and Marvels(will probably appear in 2024 disney plus).  So 2 shows is TOO much content for you all paying customers of an entire streaming service? Sure, I'll even take Mando 3 and Ashoka as content. That's four live action shows for an entire year!  

This is not about how much TIME they spend. They literally have all the money in the world. They need to hire the right people, pay them the right amount of money, and give them the APPROPRIATE amount of time to make the shows. As the Flash movie has proved, given Nine years to make a movie can also result in a superhero stuffing wierd CGI babies in a microwave. Its NOT just about the time. Hire the right People. Listen to the fans. Green light the essential Shows. They made Endgame in 2-3 years and it was a freaking masterpiece. Spend the money wisely. Did secret invasion seem like 212 million dollar show to you? Did all the money just go to the cast? If you could give me a better script and sacrificed Colman and Emilia clarke with lesser known actors, I'd take that deal any day. I'd even take out Rhodey or hobbit's cameos to take down that budget and kept maria hill alive.

This Secret invasion show was so flawed at the writing stage. Its not just about whether the story was good or bad, alot of it didn't make a tiny bit of sense. The PREMISE of the story was not laid out correctly. WHY can't they find a home for skrulls? Is it because skrulls are an invasive species that literally no one can trust, not even themeselves? Of all the billions of planets out there, NOT even one planet could take them? NOT EVEN THE EMPTY ONES?  Or do skrulls thrive when infiltrating and invading a planet? Should we make apparent that Gravik's movitvations are instead his daddy issues of having a father figure that would ask him to murder in the name of justice? Should we not have seen some Flashbacks of this happening?  Should this maybe come up in Episode 1? Are skrulls only capable of mimicking and unable to create an original character? What if they took the face of someone but changed it slightly so they are not the same person? Have they not considered that someone with the power to shapeshift living on a planet with people that have no powers.. is like being a god of some sort? Why, why would anyone agree to rebel against this heaven?  This movtivation of ""living in your own skin"" is such bullshit when addressing shapeshifting skrulls. Should the story not have been premised as humans figuring out that there are skrulls amongst them and gravik is trying to protect his own kind by snuffing out these curious people?  Should we hire tv writers that are good at making 40-50 minute episodes consistently? Or shoud we just randomly chop up a 4 hour movie into random bits and pieces and call it an episode?

All this stuff that I, redditors and podcasters have thought of in like literally our spare time should have been thought out by people at marvel. Like, this is about hiring competent people. I'd be so freaking angry if I was Samuel L jackson. I feel so bad for the guy, for the legacy of nick fury. 

But back to my main point. If they made any less material, we are literally talking about one live action show a year. Why should we paying customers advocate for that? How about maybe more contained stories that don't involve the end of the world? Character stories that can exist without drastically affecting the MCU. Heroes for hire? Shang chi Stories? Something ground level that can build up to something bigger later on? "

Marvel Studios has lost the ability to create hype.,Forsaken_Professor79,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15d2ose/marvel_studios_has_lost_the_ability_to_create_hype/,1690664204.0,"There was a time when the MCU was king of the post credit scene. But even before that each film did a great job of world building while not feeling bogged down by it. (I know ppl complain about IM2 and AOU but I don’t see it but I digress.) Secret Invasion is the biggest example of this obviously but Phase 4 and so far Phase 5 have failed to deliver a cohesive overall narrative.

Phase 4 was the great reset of the universe. New players in a new world. And yet….the MCU seems so foreign now. It’s so hard to believe the world (Earth anyway) appears so normal after so much has happened. Endgame did a good job in a few minutes of showing how bleak things were through Scott’s POV. And that’s pretty much all we get save for a few lines here and there. Far From Home, FATWS, Hawkeye and WandaVision all somewhat cover post Blip life but it’s more the main characters adjusting to the new world and little of what the new world is. Given we just went through a pandemic and witness the  lasting effects of it but surely half the world disappearing should have larger effects on the world than “displaced people”. Yet it seems like things are back to normal. She-Hulk and Ms. Marvel had a huge opportunity to give us more into this new life and honestly doesn’t. People with powers just exist or always have and feel comfortable coming out now (I’m not missing the allegory here)

I don’t expect every set up to pay off immediately but it’s blatantly obvious the creative heads at Marvel Studios are spread thin. Writer/Director teams are not on the same page with other projects. In fact it seems like the comics where a writer may do something in their run only to be forgotten by the next team.

I know COVID affected a lot of Phase 4 but by now things shouldn’t be so out of sync. It’s taking way too long to see characters again. We should’ve had an Avengers film at the end of Phase 4 to establish a new team and get their feet wet before Kang Dynasty. From the looks of things Brave New World may do that but this game of where are the Avengers is silly. There should always be a core team. In fact they could’ve built on what the team did during those five years and established the West Coast, Great Lakes, and other Avenger teams. Maybe a spin on the 50 State initiative without the Accords.

Now back to Secret Invasion….I hope President Ritson’s stupidity pays off because I really don’t see how this mess can be explained away easily.

At least we have Loki , Daredevil, and Deadpool eventually."

I only ask because I think I have enjoyed the projects in the past year but they are all the worst reviewed MCU movies and i'm confused. Guardians 3 is the only great one but I liked Thor 3, Dr. Strange 2, Antman 3, Black Panther 2, and Moon Knight as well.

Also there is an alt-right movement to pile on negativity any time the MCU empowers a female character. It muddies the conversations online and I'm trying to get a sense of what problems people actually had for the show. 

[The movement is called ""get woke go broke"" for those who are not in the know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_woke_go_broke)

For me, the show was okay. Similar quality to most MCU projects. It furthers the MCU narrative more than most recent projects but still has a general aimlessness present in post MCU movies. Fury doesn't grow but we learn more about him. The story with the Skrulls definitely progresses. It sets up a new Skrull empire for a future conflict. The show moves global politics on earth forward for the first time in a long time.

I don't think the show is great by any means. I generally like the more comedic tone, Marvel universe, projects so I realize other people have different taste in these movies. "

Or you pick up the new Ms marvel solo but hypothetically they didn’t just retcon her and wait… she’s not a mutant?! Would you stop reading right then and there? 

Or let’s say you took an interest in Wanda and picked up her new solo and let’s say they didn’t make Agatha a whole new character because of wandavision. Would you stop reading if it turned out agatha is an elderly woman in the comics? 

Or when civil war came out, would you actually be interested in reading an event named civil war 2 because oh the mcu just released a movie called civil war!

I've seen the argument that stormbreaker had his blood in Infinity War. Yeah 5 years ago when Fury didn't even know about Thanos and also blipped. Then people saying he was decapiated in Endgame. Yeah also 5 years ago, on a different planet, and Fury was gone, both before he gave orders to collect DNA samples.
I've heard of other arguments blahblah I just wanna know how his DNA survived being blipped. Groot is an exception, his arm was severed from his body and used as stormbreakers handle. I'm assuming the same enchantment that makes stormbreaker unable to break applies to the whole weapon, meaning the handle too.

I've watched the whole show and endured it, but I was pleasantly surprised when they aired the fourth episode of She-Hulk. I felt that all the good elements of the She-Hulk COMIC were present: comedy, legal aspects, goofiness, 4th-wall breaks, romance, etc. Everything was well-balanced, and I even found myself enjoying the character of Madisynn and her dynamic with Wong. (I know, some people can disagree)

This is the only episode I can rewatch just for a good laugh. The way she tries to have some sugar but ends up being caught in the middle of a ""I have to be a superhero NOW"" situation is quite comical. I feel that the show was ALMOST there with that episode. Better writing would've helped though.

To be honest, despite all the criticism the show receives, this episode was better than Secret Invasion and Ms. Marvel combined.

That the world learning about skrulls would lead to the u.s government declaring all non humans living on earth to be enemies, and that this would lead to anti mutant sentiment when they emerge and will plant the seeds for the sentinels and purifiers. For those not familiar with the purifiers, in the comics thier an evangelical Christian terrorist group that targets mutants. I thought this was ridiculous so I never posted it but we see that exact thing happen at the end where the president declares war on non humans and further more we see independent actors committing terrorist attacks on peope they think are skrulls.

I assume this is arranged by Captain Marvel and was a set up for an early scene in her film.

Now, given that the reason the Skrulls need a new home is because they're being actively hunted across the galaxy by the Kree, doesn't the fact that Fury and Danvers were ONE WEEK away from ending that centuries old war and therefore allowing the Skrulls to just go hang out wherever they want without fear of a Kree battlefleet showing up in orbit and levelling the place, mean that instead of failing the Skrulls in return for their helping Fury out, they have actually succeeded perfectly beyond the wildest dreams that any of the Skrulls could possibly conceive of and they're solving all of their problems?

Shouldn't the Skrull council have been aware of this peace conference that they'd be currently packing to go to and been deliriously happy about the fact that Captain Marvel, and therefore Fury, has fulfilled her end of the deal so spectacularly?

The mere existence of this peace conference seems to undermine the entire premise of the central conflict of the show."

The first saga of the MCU was almost entirely curated by Fiege, the Russos and Weidon.

Now it just seems like marvel are trying to recapture that by giving others the opportunity, but it just seems like none of these separate teams are communicating, resulting in all the recent projects feeling disconnected with wild, what would of been in previous phases, world changing events now just being ignored as the next person in charge either doesn’t know or care.

I don't think there's any grand theory for why the MCU's bad.,Midi_to_Minuit,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c1zi1/i_dont_think_theres_any_grand_theory_for_why_the/,1690561304.0,"People offer up a lot of explanations as to why the MCU's on the downward trend.

* They're too interconnected! Not enough standalone projects!
* They're not interconnected enough! The projects don't connect anymore!
* There's no buildup to bigger events!
* Everything is buildup to bigger events!
* The directors aren't given enough individual control!
* Their is no unifying vision!

And to be honest with you, I think these are just knee-jerk reactions that we give project-by-project because they're *diametrically opposed*. We like to create big explanations as to why something is having a systemic failure but I'm gonna go with Occam's Razor here and say that the MCU's on a downward trend because of Endgame Burnout + Disney+ glut.

Maybe it's pessimistic but I don't see any more to it than a simple ""the writing is bad"" and ""quantity &gt; quality"". There isn't any consistent trend between 'good' and 'bad' phase 4 &amp; 5 projects: for a great example, Secret Invasion and Quantumania have literally NOTHING alike yet are both reviled, because they're *just not written very well*. The Disney+ shows vary massively in tone, genre and quality, but they're overall not very strong because they're produced en masse with the same restrictive format."

Is she really that powerful?,Antman269,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c7d9k/is_she_really_that_powerful/,1690573984.0,"A bunch of people are saying that Giah is now the most powerful character in the MCU due to taking the harvest and getting the powers of all those other characters. But do we really know that for sure?

Since it’s only small samples of each character’s DNA and is not entirely pure, what’s to say the individual powers are actually as powerful as their donors? We can’t really know for sure how far Giah scales since the only enemy she fights is Gravik, who took the exact same thing as her. 

For example, they both use a form of Captain Marvel’s powers, but what’s to say that level of power is actually equivalent to Carol’s? She may still be stronger than them.

I’d assume Gravik planned on creating an army of super skrulls with the harvest. I doubt one would really be that big of a threat.

r/Marvelstudios marks the end of my disheartened detachment from MCU.,aguyingrey,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c1dm9/rmarvelstudios_marks_the_end_of_my_disheartened/,1690559900.0,"*Disclaimer: Art, including Movies &amp; TV shows, is purely subjective. I genuinely mean no disrespect or any negative connotation to anyone with a different opinion from mine.*

I won't be the first to say that the MCU has seen a decline in quality, and it appears to be a common sentiment in recent times. It's disheartening to see what was once a captivating saga turning into a commercial chain solely focused on minting money for Disney. Of course, production houses create content to make a profit, but it's becoming increasingly apparent that the creators have now become the chasers.

Marvel made a groundbreaking mark in the entertainment industry by proving that cinematic universes could work, defying the skepticism of the entire market. However, the success of the MCU has led every production house, franchise, and company with any IP to attempt to create their cinematic universe (Yes, I'm looking at you, Mattel Cinematic Universe).

As an internet nobody, I don't intend to tell Marvel Executives how to run their company, but I can't help feeling that they may be forgetting the main reason the MCU worked in the first place. Its novelty lay in the interconnectivity and crossovers between movies, which was a rarity back then. Unfortunately, this uniqueness has faded, and audiences can't be expected to invest the same enthusiasm for every production. It's no longer that special.

Unlike some critics who are simply saying, ""It's not cool anymore,"" I do acknowledge that MCU productions were always mainstream content. My personal tipping point was with Doctor Strange, where my faith in Marvel began to waver. The abundance of MCU content now feels overwhelming, providing negligible returns for dedicated viewers like myself. I miss the days when watching a single movie could suffice to build anticipation for the next one.

Credit is due to Marvel for attempting to incorporate different cinematic tools, tropes, and themes, and collaborating with various auteurs to bring variety to their storytelling. However, it seems that these ""different"" auteurs are still confined within the box that Marvel Execs have set, resulting in a mixed bag of experiences. At least Marvel previously embraced its tropes with pride.

Additionally, the monumental achievement of Endgame placed them at the peak of success. Naturally, anything that follows will be perceived as a downhill journey. I wonder if they could have explored new territories rather than relying solely on the trust established with the previous high.

P.S. I would genuinely appreciate it if you could help me see things from a different perspective. Despite my growing concerns, I still care deeply about these characters and their stories. It's painful to consider letting go due to decisions made in board meetings."

Why are there practically no recurring villains in the MCU?,laser16,194,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b3rx6/why_are_there_practically_no_recurring_villains/,1690469101.0,"One thing that became a glaring issue for me after Secret Invasion was the wasted opportunity of a character like Gravik. A shapeshifter with a vendetta against humanity, countless connections and a potluck of superpowers? That feels like the perfect opportunity to have him pop up in more projects going forward. And you don’t even have to use the same actor every time. So why aren’t there more recurring villains?

Obviously there are very few exceptions like Kingpin (barely) and Kang if you’re include variants (and really we’ve only gotten 1 1/2). But I feel like every villain we’ve gotten is either killed off, never seen again or redeemed in some way. A few examples of good villains that could have been recurring:

Gravik - killed off

Loki - redeemed (for the best, but still)

Ulysses Klaue - killed off

Agatha Harkness - will more than likely have some kind of heroic turn in her own show

Red Skull - never seen again

Justin Hammer - never seen again

"The MCU's made a lot of Diseny+ Shows, What should their futures be?",JMRanger1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c6eo3/the_mcus_made_a_lot_of_diseny_shows_what_should/,1690571711.0,"Marvel made a ***lot*** of Diseny+ shows and I think this level of quantity stops people get invested in the shows because stops the flow of new seasons. Want Loki season 2? Sorry, you gotta cycle through 8 other shows, all very different with very different audiences before we'll get around to it. Many of these projects also become essential viewing for films, leaving people confused when they haven't seen them. I think limiting the number of shows, moving some characters to film and continuing the shorter, cheaper special presentations is the solution and below is my list of what the fates of these shows would be.

* **WandaVision** \- Move to film, give Scarlet Witch a movie already!
* **The Falcon and the Winter Soldier** \- Move to film, Captain America 4 and The Thunderbolts
* **Loki** \- Continue, season 2 is coming soon and they should do a third.
* **Hawkeye** \- Spin-off, A Champions series, Kate Bishop Lead, Ms. Marvel as a key character.
* **Moon Knight** \- Continue, they should announce second season.
* **Ms. Marvel** \- Move to film, The Marvels
* **She-Hulk: Attorney at Law** \- Special Presentations, make multiple, shorter and therefore a lot less expensive for a Law Comedy series with a CGI lead. Also a key character in future Hulk films (if they happen).
* **Secret Invasion** \- One and Done, Fury will continue to appear in lots of projects because he's Nick Fury!
* **Echo** \- One and Done, dropping all episodes the same day kinda shows they don't have long-term plans for this one, Echo will return in Daredevil: Born Again as well.
* **Ironheart** \- Move to film, Armor Wars
* **Agatha: Coven of Chaos** \- ???, No Idea, really depends on what the show is gonna be.
* **Daredevil: Born Again** \- Continue, - they should announce another season.

If they did this some of their most popular series in Daredevil, Loki and Moon Knight would have more regular seasons, while the new special presentations would fill in the gaps. What do you think these shows futures should be? Which ones do you cut? And which ones do you keep?"
Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is what super hero movies should aim to be.,frodominator,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c0hgb/guardians_of_the_galaxy_3_is_what_super_hero/,1690557848.0,"I've just watched Guardians vol. 3 and oh boy! 
While it has some minor flaws, it is a great great movie! The thing that I noticed the most is that it has a heart. The characters are so lovely in their only way and each of them has nice small details here and there that really make them shine (Mantis floating down to Orgcorp, Drax being good with kids, etc). And Rocket...I cried a river.
Another thing that kept me hooked on is that I knew that this was the last movie of this formation, so any of the guardians could die, at any time... It had a great feeling of real danger to characters so loved. 
I felt that James Gunn put his heart into this movie and all the hero movies should have this too. They are heroes and nobody needs to mention it, their actions speak for themselves.
The High Evolutionary really was a great villain and the actor was incredible! 
This is the best trilogy of the mcu and I think it won't be beaten. I'll miss this formation and this kind of movie. It had been a long time since I felt so good watching a Marvel movie."

Also who’s going to stop the living tribunal (who’s been teased a couple times) and other higher cosmic entities (if they don’t make them wishing wells this time lol) from preventing all this and stopping the kangs with a blink? 

Kangs tech is still just tech, yeah the TVA where pruning timelines but I didn’t really take
That as destroying whole universes, rather catching the split in its early stages while it can be stopped. Otherwise why bother with an incursion plot at all when you can just have kangs running round pruning the shit out of the multiverse instead?

Viewership was not maintained constant throughout the season. The reviews out right now range from mixed to negative. We are seeing disappointment being expressed quite openly and frequently in MCU related reddit pages. 

So, given how this flopped, should we expect Emilia Clarke to want to continue with the MCU? or that the MCU producers will want to have her back? Add to this that hiring her is likely quite expensive. 

I just don't think the chances of Emilia returning in a future project look good. Which opens a can of worms: a mediocre show casually created one of the most overpowered characters in the MCU, but there is a real possibility Giah doesn't show up again in a future project. How is that going to be handled? 

Anyone else worried about the possibility that the plots opened up in Secret Invasion will be handwaved or dropped in future projects?"

If you could rewrite the MCU run of Secret Invasion — how would you have written the story? What would you have included or taken out?,psyfyr,20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15bk96j,1690509412.0,"This is my *quick* version adapted by mashing up the show with the comics. 

Queen Veranke is the crisis level threat this show was missing along with the paranoia and suspense element being more subtle like in Captain Marvel when you really weren’t sure who was who and Skrulls were stealing new identities constantly — shapeshifting being utilized in a way that was more insidious and mysterious. I also think they should have made the nature of this alien species invading the planet a little more terrifying altogether rather than painting them as a mostly peaceful race. Veranke could have been leading Warskrulls from within the planet/government and Fury could have slowly discovered mid-series that there is a cloaked mothership orbiting outside the planet and she has been monitoring Earth-616 from for some time now… with an army of Skrulls waiting to be unleashed on humanity… then Talos alerts Giah who alerts Gravik who already knows because he is working for her… that’s where Giah and Gravik have their split and Giah alerts other Skrulls to this… then they begin having a civil war while Fury and Talos now deal with threats from both the inside and outside…

As the Skrulls begin waging war on one another there are instances popping up around the world of aliens being murdered and found on the streets… the President is then alerted to the Skrull invasion fleet outside the planet… and decides to alert the people by waging war on all Skrulls… people become aware of their presence and some radical groups start attacking those they think are Skrulls… then the de-cloaking of the mothership happens as Veranke sends a message to the inhabitants of Earth-616 informing them that their planet will now be boarded as world leaders have been compromised. Any city that does not give their allegiance shall be fired upon and destroyed entirely. Classic alien invasion style throwing back to old sci-fi films. This is when she sends in the Super Skrulls to cities across the planet to begin managing resistance and murdering anyone who tries to stop them. Super heroes real identities start coming to light as people realize they have little defense.

The resolution could be finding the Super Skrull device Gravik was operating secretly to create an army behind the scenes and having Talos, Varra, and Giah use it to then team up with Fury for the infiltration of the mothership — all leading to the capture and surrender of Veranke, which would anger the rest of her queendom and cause future tension and lingering threat between the larger Skrull Empire and Earth-616 as they plan to free their queen. The heroes that were left taking down the Super Skrulls as a soft new Avengers appearance and finding their real comrades locked away in an underground base. The American president being impeached and taken out of office. Sonya taking over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury returning to S.A.B.E.R. after having actually accomplished something rather than leaving the planet worse off than he found it — so he is redeemed and his purpose restored which was the whole point of showing him as a fallen man the entire series.

Honestly, most any other version would have been better had it included Veranke and introduced a larger Skrull Empire having a presence in the universe — making the stakes for the Kree-Skrull war heightened and having a real effect on the greater MCU. This would only be possible to execute properly if the episodes were 45 minutes+ and there were at least 9-10 in the series. They absolutely squandered all potential this show had by trying to be so different from the comics that they defeated the entire purpose of Secret Invasion. It didn’t feel like an alien invasion at all — it felt like a generic terrorist attack level threat not much different from plots we’ve seen in other MCU shows. It made sense in FATWS, but it was repetitive and irrelevant to this story and there should have been a fresh and unique plot for the foundation of this show."

same problem with one-and-done villains. how cool would it be if villains from a random movie came back for other shows? this seems like it would be way less likely if A-list celebrities were cast as the villains (christian bale and gorr come to mind)

I  will also take this opportunity to remind people that She-Hulk did not really perform poorly relative to other Marvel Studios Disney+ shows. It only appears to do poorly if you don't account for it's lower than average episode length, naturally yielding fewer raw minutes of viewership, even for the same number of viewers. That's probably why it didn't make the charts in the first week. it's hard if you only have half as much potential view time per person as other shows."

People can jump on here and downvote me, but only the most diehard fans are still excited or optimistic about every MCU product.

I used to enjoy watching the shows and films with my kids. They don't want to watch them anymore. MCU entertainment has gone from must-see to ""maybe I'll get around to it."" It's sad to see, but maybe it's time for Feige to step down and let someone new take the reins. He's been doing it for almost 20 years.

Here’s my main point:
Skrhodey, kidnapped and replaced after Civil War, could’ve been an amazing, tragic story. But it needed two scenes. 
It needed a scene/montage/episode?! with Tony Stark. The Skrull has replaced Rhodey, simply to stay close to the Avengers and keep tabs on them for Talos/Gravik. In this scene/montage we see Rava learning more about the best of Tony. She sees him work to help his friend walk again, his joy as Rhodey “miraculously” recovers, his work with humanity. Maybe she even falls a bit in love with him, happy that he has Pepper and Morgan. Maybe, there’s a badass fight scene in the armors. This clears up every point of Rhodey fighting with Tony in IW, Endgame, crying at his death, etc. 
Then a scene with Fury. Skrhodey explains how fury and humanity have thrown away the legacy of Tony Stark. Fury has pissed off to space and chaos reigns on Earth (maybe a FATWS or wnadavision reference). Rava has become a total nihilist, replacing Tony with Gravik and his plans. Fury still kills her, but now maybe he has to deal with the fact that Skrhodey was actively protecting earth while he was blipped.
Does this fix the show? No. But if you’re going to retcon stuff, it has to make sense in universe.
Now the problem. These types of flashbacks are almost impossible. I doubt RDJ would do this. Even if he was willing, are you going to shell out 10mil for this cameo? Hulk has been the professor since endgame(boo) I liked Hawkeye because Hawkeye was in it! Thor’s last movie was… not great and Hemsworth might be taking a break? Chris Evans has said no more Cap. (No Wolverine/Cap in WWII. sad face) can you get Scarjo? Bautista? So any character that carried over from phase 1-3, can never interact with these past characters. This makes retconning infinitely harder because the past is set. There can no longer be “show don’t tell”. Take my above example. Now Rhodey just says all this stuff about Tony. Same scenarios. Maybe he has tears in his eyes. But does that have the same impact? 
It might have been better to wipe the slate clean of characters connected to phase 1-3 or keep them away from anything that needs to change what happened before.

TLDR: The MCU needs to stop retconning stories that would require or be helped by it’s legacy actors"
Secret Invasion was a nadir for the MCU,futurific,854,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15anty6/secret_invasion_was_a_nadir_for_the_mcu/,1690420585.0,"Yeah, I’m jumping on the bandwagon here. That was rough, folks. A crossover-level event that was a total non-event. They never sold the stakes, characters were either introduced or killed off with no emotional impact, and I don’t buy for a second that anything that happened mattered.

So much of post-ENDGAME has felt disconnected and disposable. And that’s fine if we’re on an experimental detour like WandaVision or Moon Knight, or in an extra-dimensional space like Loki. 

But you compare Secret Invasion with something like the Avengers, and it falls short on every level. This isn’t a culmination of storylines that intertwine to make everything feel bigger. It’s a big blinking sign that says, “Nothing matters, we’re just killing time, running out contrasts, and exploiting pre-existing IP.”

It’s like someone in the writer’s room was tasked with taking every criticism of the MCU to date and vindicating them.

A review for Quantumania called it a “cry for help.”  That movie was merely unexceptional. This show, on the other hand, is a white flag."

One way to fix the issue created in Secret Invasion finale,3bstfrds,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c6mdo/one_way_to_fix_the_issue_created_in_secret/,1690572217.0,"***Spoilers for Secret Invasion Finale***

I think a lot of fans are not quite happy about how Secret Invasion just created the seemingly most powerful being in G'iah with her possessing the powers of a lot of the superheroes. However, the way that they did the fight scene in the finale, I think there is an effective and reasonable way to nerf her down a bit. 

A lot of us had wondered, if you had the power of Thanos or Hulk, why the heck were you using Drax power at all? Or when would you ever need Winter Soldier's power? Now, if the way that the powers are set up would not allow G'iah to use one specific power for an extended period of time, it would make sense to have secondary powers and she will not be as powerful as she is portraited now (i.e. she HAS the power of Carol Danvers, for example, but can ONLY use it for, say a minute or two at a time then she will have to switch to something else and cannot use it again until x amount of time passes). That could also explain why Grevik did not just use his power to kill Ritson in ep. 4 rather than just use guns. 

This can be done so easily as well because they can make her explain her powers to Sonya when Sonya asks her similar question, like, why don't you just use Carol Danvers' power to start every fight?

The Disney+ shows have been extremely underwhelming for the most part.,hushpolocaps69,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bfqsz/the_disney_shows_have_been_extremely/,1690497310.0,"*SOME SECRET INVASION SPOILERS*




I remember when Covid was still around that I kinda figured that the pandemic was the reason why certain shows were feeling lackluster. Best example of this is FATWS since that show had a whole pandemic plot line that seemed to be one of the main plots which was cut for obvious reasons… and well the quality of the tv series shows given how most of their lead way was cut.




But we’re in 2023 now… what the fuck is going on? After that abomination that was She-Hulk (at least some people like that show) Secret Invasion was the comeback for Disney+ shows… and wow what a let down.



I think we can all agree that the finale just felt extremely lackluster and the fact that it was only 30 minutes is embarrassing. The show definitely needed more episodes or longer episodes cause this definitely could’ve been something great. 




It just pisses me off how there seems to be no love for these kind of projects anymore. Rhodey is a character we all loved for years and they don’t even elaborate on his Skrull whereabouts. Why the fuck do we gotta wait to find out I mean wasn’t that suppose to be the twist of this show? Also if Rhodey was a skrull during Endgame or Infinity War then I’m genuinely done with the MCU since that is just pure garbage right there. 





Anyhoo, when it comes to the films it definitely feels better. Sure you have some misses like Quantumania but at least that film is enjoyable thanks to Kang or some funny moments, overall though the films have a ton of hits I mean Vol 3 was extraordinary alongside Wakanda Forever and The Marvels looks great. 





Hopefully Loki S2 and Echo make up for this, but honestly I’ve disliked most of the shows and I’m really close to just avoiding all of them, felt like Secret Invasion was a waste of time for me."

My take on Secret Invasion.,eBICgamer2010,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bx3y3/my_take_on_secret_invasion/,1690549941.0,"With that $200M, it should have been just a 2-and-half-an-hour-long movie. And I would have called it Avengers: Secret Invasion.

However, I want to keep it small. It would have been like this:

* Skrulls found a new home planet. Great, it's the Garden from way back in Endgame. But the Skrulls are still being harassed by Krees. Captain Marvel is on her way to the peace summit to negotiate for peace.
* Gravik, an up-and-coming member within the Skrull Army, isn't confident about the success of the peace talk, so he acts ahead. He and his band of Skrull rebel plans to set a colony on Earth permanently, and wins support from officials of world power by disguising as them and give good enough PR to convince everyone they can stay just like New Asgardians (as depicted in Love &amp; Thunder)
* Gravik gets rid of both Talos and Soren by disguising as Fury and fooling them over the progress of the peace meeting. G'iah and Fury are on SABER and were informed by Maria Hills to come down to Earth. There the three talked about something wrong at the latest Congress meeting.
* The US was weighing relation with New Asgard over the shape-shifting incident as depicted in She-Hulk. Rhodey was initiating a vote on whether they should restrict shape-shifters from entering the US but everyone there unanimously voted no later in the day. Something's fishy going on, because it's true.
* Rhodey and everyone in the meeting are Skrulls. Fury boards a flight to LA to recruit She-Hulk because she dealt with the New Asgardian shape-shifting case before. Then Fury, Hills, Walter and G'iah ambush a podcast, catch a rebel Skrull acting as PR and force that Skrull to tell Gravik's ploy.
* Gravik's in his hideout in Russia. That's where they want to colonize and also where they kept most of the abducted officials there, Rhodey too, though that place isn't radioactive. Fury's band arrive in time and catch him off-guard.
* There were skirmishes as She-Hulk hulks out to scare the rebels. G'iah found out about her dead parents and got emotional. Gravik's force gets wiped out by She-Hulk. Gravik tries to back out but G'iah had a standoff with him. There's pretty much no CGI battle between the two Skrulls here like in the show because they didn't use any machine to give them Super Saiyan power. AT ALL.
* The good Skrulls band alongside G'iah, who have heard of good news surrounding the peace talk, agree to execute him. In the end, a new status quo emerges: Skrulls finally found a home without being threatened by the Krees or stabbed by the rotten apples.
* From the event, Fury got spooked. He now goes back to recruiting mode, starting with She-Hulk and a recovering War Machine. In a post credit scene, various news outlets announce that US incumbent president lost the election to General Ross, who had continuously criticized his handling of the event."
When to call it quits on the MCU,Tonycam24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ch73h/when_to_call_it_quits_on_the_mcu/,1690599765.0,"So, like many of people here, I am becoming disillusioned with the MCU. In phases 4 and 5 we’ve had some high points but many more low points than we’re used to. Secret Invasion being the lowest low for me.

Now that Marvel/Disney is saying that they see the problem the way a lot of us see it: lately it’s been quantity over quality. This is what gives me hope, and a deadline for when I’m going to call it quits on the MCU.

From my best guesses, The Marvels, Loki s2 and Echo were written and mostly produced during the “quantity” times. Because of that I am giving it 2 projects after Echo. If there is an improvement than I will continue following this franchise since day 1. If not, I guess I’ll have to hope James Gunn can make DC work. As always, I have faith in Feige but my faith has limits.

tldr; wait until after the currently in productions of MCU projects are released before giving up on the franchise."

Too many shows (we get 3-4 per year and will this year) that are too short. 

Ideally Daredevil is the beginning of longer form storytelling, but after it Wonder Man and Vision Quest are next on the docket. My ""hope"" is that they are all that exist for assumedly 2026. I say that year for several reasons:

- Due to the strikes I highly doubt Ironheart, Agatha and DD all release next year

- This means the only completed shows premiering in 2024 will likely be Ironheart and Agatha

- 2025 may be solely reserved for Daredevil, given its length and current rumor it is being split up similar to Andor's 24 episode story. I.e. 2, 9 episode ""seasons""

- 2026 would then be Wonder Man and Vision Quest,


At this point, Marvel could hopefully course correct on show rollout. A big issue is too much is going on and not enough payoff is being seen in the films. Let the films catch up. Let The Marvels payoff WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. Let CA4, Thunderbolts payoff F+WS and Hawkeye, etc.

On the concern of second seasons, I argue that second seasons of Hawkeye, Moon Knight, She-Hulk, and Ms. Marvel ideally need to just wait like films at this point. Ms. Marvel not included, but ideally Jen and Marc should be in some other property beforehand, not just isolated to Season 2's of their shows. And unfortunately all of that is taking (the necessary) time. 

Idk, we all talk about Marvel slowing down, but I feel like THIS is how you slow down. Its a shame itll take so long to see characters like Shang-Chi (or set up characters like Dane Whitman) again, but at this point, Marvel doesnt have a choice really.

And the concern for Young Avengers and aging, I think we'll just see the ""Ultimates"" instead eventually. 


Tldr:

- 2023: The Marvels, Loki S2, Echo
- 2024: CA4, DP3, Ironheart and Agatha (thats it, Thunderbolts definitely is delayed)
- 2025: Thunderbolts, Blade, F4, Spider-Man 4 (maybe), Daredevil 
- 2026: Armor Wars, Avengers Kang Dynasty, Wonder Man, and Vision Quest (likely another film i.e. Doctor Strange 3 or Shang-Chi 2 but theres nothing else currently on the docket that not just a ""rumor"")"

That is if Secret Wars still happens. But there’s a lot of criticism about the series. And I agree that it had issues.

Looking at it from this perspective helps alleviate how I think about some of the choices made.

What's it like for New Asgard? Thor relocated all the Asgardians to New Asgard in Norway after their home planet was destroyed. Valkyrie might be dealing with enough as it is and now the president wants this bill as a kneejerk reaction to the events of Secret Invasion.

Some of the kids in New Asgard look very different from humans, and it's probably not easy fitting in. Same goes for the skrulls and they had to maintain a hideout in Russia to survive. Would New Asgard have been willing to help the skrulls out? And why didn't Fury tell anyone about New Asgard? He must know about it right?

I’m not a writer, I’ve had ups and downs with the MCU, but Secret Invasion is the first thing I’ve absolutely disliked. And it’s at least partially because it was about so many things we had never seen and were never explained.

They really under-utilised him so much in Iron Man 2, and honestly he'll make a really interesting anti-hero/villain in Armor Wars,

plus he's perfect to take the place of Iron Man, in a similar manner John walker was, but Hammer is just as eccentric as Tony Stark, and now that Iron Man is no more, it's a perfect opportunity for him to steal the limelight again from Stark Industries."

2)What is the Skrull colony with the emperor? It was just mentioned in 1 sentence and then never again

3)When was rhodey replaced? “A long time” was so clearly the writers saying “it’s not our problem, that’s a job for the next guy”

4)when was Ross replaced?

5)if gravik’s plan revolved around the US president declaring war why wouldn’t he just replace the president and do it himself

6)Why can’t the skrulls live on Thanos’ garden? It’s huge, Thanos was the only inhabitant, it can support life, and no one knows about it except the avengers (including Carol). If the kree could find them there then why wouldn’t the kree be able to find them anywhere? And if the reason why they never come to earth is because of Carol and the avengers why would Gravik antagonize the humans and the avengers against the skrulls?

7)why would Skrull rhodey call Fury “Nick” if it knows that rhodey never calls him Nick (by having all Rhode’s memories

8)if aSkrull has all the memories of the host do they also care about the loved ones of that person?

9)what happened to that boy after Talos killed his “father”. Did Fury and Talos not explain anything? Is that boy now just alone and traumatized? Was he a Skrull? Probably not as Fury and Talos never question or kill him. And he doesn’t serve any tactical benefit to replace. And fury was holding him hostage and a Skrull would easily be able to overpower fury.

10)The skrulls’ shapeshifting abilities are very ill defined. Can they change into animals? We know that skrulls can’t tell if a Skrull is disguised as something else so what is stopping anyone from impersonating anyone? How do they have a society at all? Like why wouldn’t Gaia or Talos shift into Gravik and call everything off?

11)why didn’t the tortured Skrull shift into a smaller person to slip out of the chains? Why couldn’t he break the chains like he said he would?

12)Why did Fury make Gravik kill the man he is disguised as? It would have been nice to know the context of that kill.

13)why does no one (except Olivia Coleman) check that who they are talking to is who they are talking to if there is a possibility that they are a Skrull? Why not just cut off some hair or take a drop of blood if it changes after it’s separated from the main Skrull body then their cover is blown.

14)why wouldn’t Gravik make more super skrulls for his army? And if some of the skrulls planned to turn on him why didn’t they make themselves super skrulls like Gaia did?

15)why give Gravik the harvest in the first place ultimately it didn’t do anything

16)why did the skrulls rely on just fury to find them a planet and what were those other 1,000,000 skrulls doing for 30 years. 

17)where were fury’s skrulls during the events of the MCU? They would have been very useful in winter soldier or avengers or aou or infinity war etc…

18)how did the captured humans survive the radiation in the skrulls’ base?

19)why did Gaia use a Geiger counter if she is immune to the radiation?

20) why was Gaia able to kill Gravik so easily if they have the same powers? Why wouldn’t Gravik just stay as Carol Danvers who is immune to everything and has the strongest power output anyway? What is the point of using Drax dna when you can use Carol?

21)why are skrulls and kree making peace suddenly?

22)how were the kree always able to find the skrulls?

23)why is graviks first response to kill all humans even though no one knows about the skrulls and haven’t had a chance to be peacefull with them? 

24)why wouldn’t fury call for help from some of the non powered avengers like Hawkeye or Ant man or falcon or even Bucky or any of the magic users like strange and wong he didn’t even try consulting with Bruce who is one of the smartest people in the world"

There’s been a ton of shows where the villain became “the hero”. I’m not going to waste time naming all of them but there are some characters out there on some shows and movies that have committed some extremely heinous acts and fans have come to love them over time. People are out here watching Negan on the Walking Dead and he bashed Glenn’s head in. 


1 - MBJ is a prominent young black actor. He’s bankable, men like him and women find him attractive. He’s a strong enough actor to play Creed. He would’ve been a good Black Panther going forward. People would have been more than happy to support. Even if some Marvel fans were upset about it, minorities would have showed up in droves to watch it like they did in BP1.

2 - You could’ve just showed that T’Challa did not honor his wishes after their fight and saved him. The early parts of the second movie could have shown him hurt, badly injured and recuperating in some facility in Wakanda. You could have Shuri and Ramona deliberating about whether to imprison Killmonger for his crimes while he was recuperating.

3 - You could have still had T’Challa die some way. By sickness or in battle. Then you could still have Narmor prey on Wakanda and attack while they were in mourning. With T’Challa not around to protect them and Wakanda being flooded/destroyed by Narmor, you could easily justify Ramona becoming desperate and enraged and deciding to release Killmonger from prison to fight Narmor. You could also easily show flashbacks to Killmonger “technically dying” or having an out of body experience after BP1, going to the ancestral realm where he spent more time with N’Jobu and T’Chaka and the other kings where he was either forgiven by them for what he did or with him forgiving T’Chaka for what he did to his father and to him as a kid. All of this could easily explain him wanting to repent for his choices once he woke back up. And him defeating Narmor would’ve led to him not going back to prison and having an uneasy truce between Shuri and Killmonger. Maybe Shuri also creates a way to immobilize Killmonger if he ever did anything like in BP1 in the future. 

4 - He didn’t have to become King. He could’ve become their version of Bucky. Attaining penance by becoming the protector of Wakanda while Shuri became Queen. You could’ve still introduced Toussaint and had Killmonger train him to become the next Black Panther. That way, this T’Challa/Toussaint would grow up learning everything from Killmonger in terms of battle strategy, weapons training, arm to arm combat, etc. while Shuri educated him academically which is how you get the more grizzled/hardened/genius/playboy version of T’Challa that we see in the comics. And this T’Challa would grow up in time for the X-Men arc in Marvel and eventually meet/marry Storm.

5 - Seeing Killmonger redeem himself would have been great storytelling. A scene in the ancestral realm with T’Chaka and Killmonger would have been powerful. Maybe N’Jobu is forgiven. Killmonger building a life for himself in Wakanda would have been something that blacks in the diaspora would relate to as they were cut off from their homelands due to the slave trade. Seeing Killmonger embrace his Wakandan heritage while struggling with remorse for what he did in his previous life and knowing that many Wakandans would’ve still looked at him with distrust and scorn even if he protected them from Narmor would have been an interesting dynamic. 

It could’ve worked in my opinion."
Answering a couple of misconceptions from the SI finale,KostisPat257,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c5syt/answering_a_couple_of_misconceptions_from_the_si/,1690570327.0,"I was underwhelmed and disapointed by SI as well.

It wasn't a paranoid thriller/mystery like it was supposed to be, it was too small in scale and too self-contained, it did a lot of tell, but not much show in order to present and develop its characters and its story properly, it was a movie chopped up in pieces with each piece not advancing the plot enough or have enough mystery and intrigue to warrant a weekly release and it fumbled Fury's character development and the coherence of his motivations at the end.

That said, there are some things that people are criticising the finale for that are just misconceptions, so I would like to clear them up.

1. Drax's tattoos, Hulk's pants, Ebony Maw's rings etc are of course not part of their DNA. But you are forgetting that these are SKRULLS. They are not just imitating these people's powers, but also their external appearance. A skrull can turn into Drax and they can copy his tattoos as well without even needing his DNA. What he needs the DNA for is to take Drax's powers. So G'iah ad Gravik imitating these heroes' and villains' appearances is unrelated to them using their powers and it was only done to visualize to the audience which powers each of them were using at each moment.
2. Fury didn't abandon the Skrulls at the end. It's apparent a week or 2 have passed since Ritson's announcement and Fury stayed on Earth, probably protecting the Skrulls, until he (probably with Carol's help) could arrange the Kree-Skrull peace talks. And since The Marvels &gt;!starts with said peace talks!&lt; according to its leaked plot, we'll get a little conclusion to the future of the Skrulls! "

The eternals I just don’t think we have room to explore simple as that. 

They Young Avengers could’ve been a fun one time TV series but the set up has been really weird. Honestly they needed the guardians/eternals approach of just introducing them all in the one Project, especially if it’s a show then that’s not too bad. 

Maybe allow some of them in other projects but ONLY where they make sense. Kate Bishop in a Hawkeye show? Sure that’s okay, America Chavez in a dr strange movie? Doesn’t fit at all. 

They honestly could’ve taken the comics approach to them and it would’ve been fine, they have their few runs (or in this case one project) then half the cast may as well be dead and the others fade in and out of obscurity, only to be written well when Al Ewing decides he wants to stick them on a random team he’s writing again. 

But this long drawn out introduction of them means by the time the project comes out not only will they have created problems in all the projects they didn’t belong in but also they won’t even be Young at all lol."

1. Fury is next to incompetent, seemly forgot like 40 years of experience, and some random british woman who likely has never interacted with a super hero can do his job better. Pretty much the only scene I can recall where he did something ""fury-like"" was when he casually disarmed Rhodie's guard and walked out like it was flipping through a magazine. Other than that, the extent of his spy powers seem to be putting listenings devices on things. Wow. His help a brother out, us people gotta stick together speech was weird af and totally out of character too. Coming from a man who can manipulate tony stark.
2. We got another literal nobody turned into a completely stacked superhero that dunks on everyone in the universe. That makes Giah and Love now. People say capt marvel too, but shes a mainline hero with her own movie so she's not a nobody. It took thor 4+ movies to reach those levels of power, while newer heroes like Sersi(I think she is the protag of eternals now?) or Shang Chi are jokes by comparison. She-hulk would get slapped around by this side character. Why are they doing this?
3. How did the hostages survive if they were being stored in an irradiated building that poisons humans within the hour?
4. Why did Giah beat Gravik one on one? It was never established that she was a better fighter or more competent, and I don't see any advantages that were given to her to tilt the fight in her favor. She just plot armored the guy out of existence.
5. Fury says he doesn't want to rely on super heroes, then relies on a super hero.

Honestly I'm not trying to nitpick, but these things were just blaring at me as I watched and I couldn't suspend my disbelief. It looks like Emilia brought her writers from GoT over."

A Rewrite of Secret Invasion,PimpNinjaMan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15c3hjb/a_rewrite_of_secret_invasion/,1690564837.0,"Secret Invasion frustrated me. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because I kept enjoying *moments* and then getting frustrated with how those moments played out or how they were (or weren't) resolved. I really didn't like the way the Super Skrull was handled and I think the power level in the finale didn't match the energy of the rest of the show. That led me to write what is basically fan fiction, but its how I would have written the show. A few caveats: 

1. I imagine the show *must* be only 6 episodes. 
2. I didn't include any changes to Sonya or Priscilla because I loved their characters. Assume as many of their scenes are retained as possible! 
3. The show must end with Skrulls being known about. 
4. Nick Fury must survive the finale. 

With those in mind, here is how *I* would've written Secret Invasion:

#  Episode 1

Gravik and co. infiltrate a SHIELD base looking for something (the audience doesn't know what it is). They don't find it and Gravik is pissed. Another person in the unit says, ""Sir, this is the fifth place we've looked."" Gravik responds, ""If we can't find it, we'll find the man who hid it."" Later, Gravik disguises himself as Maria Hill and starts committing random terrorist acts to try and get Fury down from space. The episode ends with Fury arriving on Earth.  

# Episode 2

Fury investigates Hill but gets caught by Gravik who plans to use the Skrull brain device to search for this mysterious item. Gravik is surprised by how easy it was to kidnap Fury and starts underestimating him. They find the location of the item in Fury's memoreis and leave to retrieve it. Another Skrull offers to take on Fury's body in case there's some fingerprint scan or something but Gravik says, ""No Skrull should have to sully themselves by putting on the face of this man."" Gravik then tells Fury, ""I'm leaving you alive so you can watch me do what you should’ve done years ago"" and walks away. 

# Episode 3

Maria Hill (the real one) arrives to save Fury. Hill says was investigating her imposter when she found him. He says they don't have time and calls up Talos. As Fury is explaining the situation, Talos assures him that it will be fine and gives him a place to meet. As they meet, Talos pulls out a piece of paper and reads from it: ""As he writes, without looking at the sea..."" As Talos continues reading the poem by Raymond Carver, we see Fury's memories returning. In Fury's memories, we see him hand Talos something in a box, then later we see him talking with Wong. We find out Fury asked Wong to erase his memories of hiding the item, indicating it was for the protection of Earth. Wong says he won't remove them, but he can block them with a spell. Fury agrees, and when Wong asks for a trigger phrase to remove the block, Fury hands him the book of poems and says, ""Pick your favorite."" As Talos reads the last line of the poem, it cuts back to current day and we see Talos holding the box. 

Hill asks what's so important about the box and Talos interjects and says, ""You think he's actually going to tell us? Who's Nick Fury without his secrets?"" Fury closes his eyes and then opens the box, revealing a small object. As he touches the object, a hologram of a planet appears. Talos starts tearing up and Fury explains that he found a planet for the Skrulls years ago but couldn't risk losing their help in protecting Earth. He wanted to share it with Talos, but after the 2012 attack, couldn't risk giving up his secret army. Talos storms off furious. 

# Episode 4

Gravik doesn’t find the coordinates where it was in Fury’s brain and retaliates by staging an attack on Russia by Americans. He calls Fury and tells him that he will burn the Earth if Fury doesn't give him the coordinates. Fury agrees and meets with Gravik. Fury hands over the coordinates, but then Gravik says, ""Still. With everything I've done, he *still* won't stop making us do his dirty work."" and then he shoots Fury. As Fury falls, we see it was actually Talos. This marks Gravik's shift to pure vengeance. Even though he now has the coordinates, he still wants to destroy all humans. The Skrull council tries to stop him and says they can help coordinate a retreat to this new planet, but Gravik convinces them that the humans won't take kindly to them living on their planet and stealing spaceships. The council compromises by saying they'll coordinate the retreat in secret, but Gravik is still pissed.

# Episode 5

Fury mourns Talos and talks with Hill, where he has to come to grips with all the things he's done in an effort to protect Earth. He wonders if its worth it and Hill says, ""there's no way to know for sure. All we can do is make sure there is a generation after us that lives to judge us for our actions."" Fury assumes he's about to be forced into retirement (since his secret army is about to leave the planet) when he gets a call from Rhodey. Rhodey tells him that Gravik has gone against the council and is planning on continuing to start nuclear war. Fury asks how he knows this and Rhodey says, ""I'm a Skrull. Get over it."" (a callback to Iron Man 2). Skrull Rhodey agrees to help Fury stop Gravik as long as Fury helps with the evacuation. Fury agrees, and the gang gets going. 

# Episode 6

Fury, Rhodey, and Hill infiltrate Gravik's compound to stop the attack when they realize Gravik just fought off a mutiny. They talk to a dying skrull who explains that the group worried Gravik's war would destroy their means of escape and Gravik responded by killing one of them. He's off to a russian military base to try and send a nuke to the US. Rhodey (in his War Machine armor), Fury, and Hill head to the base to stop Gravik. Gravik explains that he wants a new home, but says to Fury, “I want you to know what it’s like to watch your home burn.” Then he launches the nuke before Hill shoots him. Skrull Rhodey flies off to deal with it. Fury runs to Gravik while Hill tries to call the US to explain what’s happening. Fury apologizes to Gravik, but Gravik smiles and says, “You’ve fought so hard to protect this place, and for what? My people have had to hide for decades because *you* are so despicable that you will kill us simply for the way we look. You were meant to be our savior, and you used us. Sent us to die. For what? Earth? What does Earth have that makes it worth all this sacrifice?” As Fury struggles to answer, Gravik finally dies. 

The next scene shows the President making an address, outlining the failed attack and showing footage of Gravik’s base, with the dead skrulls as well as the retrieval of the humans Gravik was using (such as Rhodey). Rather than talking about Skrull Rhodey’s sacrifice, the message is very dark, talking about this group having infiltrated us and living among us. 

\---

And that's it! I know this is reddit and not Ao3, but I wanted to share this since so many people have been talking about what they would've done differently. I didn't include Gai'ah since I felt her character was introduced solely to have a ""good"" Super Skrull, so since I scrapped all the Super Skrull stuff it didn't fit. 

How would *you* have written Secret Invasion?

How Phase Four Should Have Ended..,_sidxx__,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15brq6b/how_phase_four_should_have_ended/,1690533780.0,"We all know phase 4 of the MCU has divided the entire fandom, although most people would agree that the general quality of projects has taken a hit. I have a few ideas on how the short-lived phase could've been way more exciting than it ended up being.

If there were an **Avengers** film at the end of Phase 4, fans and the general audience would likely be much more invested in the franchise. 

* After Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, we could've had an Avengers film, titled ""**Avengers: Judgement Day**"" which would follow the remaining Eternals on the Domo finding out about Arishem's assault on Earth, leaving them no choice but to turn to other heroes on Earth and across the cosmos. This would be a minor threat that could set up the rest of the Multiverse Saga and Kang as the big bad.
* The film could've included The Eternals, Sam Wilson's Captain America, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Captain Marvel, Thor, Shang-Chi, Scarlett Witch, Shuri's Black Panther and the Hulk. A rather smaller cast so there would be more room for characters to interact with each other and build new dynamics with each other which could be further developed in future phases. 
* This would've allowed these characters to spend more time with each other and laid the groundwork for the multiverse saga (something like defeating the Celestials eliminated forces protecting the universe from colliding with others) and introducing  Kang The Conqueror in a post-credits scene perhaps. 

This could've been a more satisfying end to the phase while paving the way for future projects, along with rewarding audiences for sitting through mediocre content.  Phase 5 could then begin to integrate younger/newer heroes into the mix (She-Hulk, Ms Marvel, Moon Knight, etc) with Phase 6 being all about alternate universes, ending with a big bang (Kang Dynasty &amp; Secret Wars).

Do ya'll think this would've worked as a bridge to the multiverse saga rather than having to wait for 5 years before all these characters could star in the same film while barely having a connection?"

However, the show needed a way to show the audience what was happening and a big grey arm by itself doesn't scream Drax.

I actually liked how they did this scene, even if it didn't quite track as real. But, then again, it's shapeshifting aliens infused with superhero DNA in a fight to save the Earth, so ""being real"" wasn't my biggest concern.

Just my opinion."
SkRhodey Explanation,NoDoubtRobocop,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bnhyp/skrhodey_explanation/,1690519322.0,"Reasons why SkRhodey was only replaced after the events of ""Endgame"" and not after ""Civil War"":

1. Memories - Its been established in Captain Marvel that Skrulls only get the most recent memories of their host body. In Endgame, when Rhodey is speaking with Nat through Hologram Video Call, he knew the history and deep relationship between Nat and Clint like he was concerned for the both of them. I highly doubt SkRhodey caring or wasting time anything at all. 

2. Leg Injury - Secret Invasion shows a Rhodey on a Hospital Gown seemingly unable to walk. That's because he was not wearing the tech supposedly helping him to walk as shown in Endgame or Infinity War. It can be said that after the events of Endgame Rhodey went to the hospital to get his injuries checked from the battle and that may be the period where he got replaced. 

3. No Gravin Plans Yet - During Civil War event, it can be assumed that Nick Fury is still in good terms with Gravik and the Skrulls even up until the event of Endgame where Gravik helped Fury to collect Avengers DNA. Hence, there can be no any justifiable reasons or whatsoever that would motivate a Skrull to switch Rhodey.

4. Heroic Moment in Endgame - During a very critical moment on Endgame where Rhodey, Rocket, and Hulk were trapped on a wasted Avengers Compound. Rhodey worked hard on saving Rocket and we can visibly see his struggles on mobilizing his leg. I don't think SkRhodey is an Oscar Actor to be able to pull out such attitude.

For example, everyone initially hating Kamala’s power re-work for Ms. Marvel but why does it have to be a 1-1 copy? I like seeing the MCU take risks, deviate from the source material a bit, and shake things up!

I kind of liken this to when music fans ask for their favorite artist to make an album that sounds like a fan favorite album from 10+ years ago. I get it’s a fan favorite but this person is not the same person as they were 10 years ago and the MCU is not Marvel Comics.

"I've noticed a surprisingly large amount of Marvel fans, joking or not, saying that the writer's strike should end in order to keep projects moving.

Don't think I need to explain that. Writers are well-paid, yes. But executives sitting in an office doing next to no work get paid hundreds or thousands of times what they do, so they're looking to get a bigger piece of that. 

The real issue is the AI. You might think, ""AI written stuff all sucks and is clearly written by a robot."" That's true. The problem is that you can have an AI program write the worst premise of all time, pay writers to rewrite it until it's in a workable state, and then the person who got the AI generated premise still owns 100% of the rights to it, despite coming up with almost none of the meat of the story themselves. 

So imagine you tell chat GPT, ""Write me a Captain America movie premise"". 

Here's a real premise I just got from Chat GPT: 

**Title: ""Captain America: Legacy Reborn""

Logline: After Steve Rogers retires from the mantle of Captain America, a new hero emerges: Michael Collins, a former Army Ranger with a mysterious past. As the new Captain America, Michael must navigate the pressures of living up to a legendary legacy while confronting a dangerous organization hell-bent on destabilizing the world order. With old allies and new adversaries, Michael must embrace the true meaning of heroism and discover what it truly takes to be a symbol of hope in a world desperate for salvation.**



So obviously that logline sucks and tells us nothing. The problem is that then Bob Iger and his pals can pay writers the lowest number possible to rewrite that into something workable. They'd have to come up with the dangerous organization, which old allies come back, who the new adversaries are, etc. And Disney would own 100% of the rights to it because they ""came up"" with the story. 

So while you may be rocking around all worried about MCU shows and movies getting delayed, there's an extremely good reason."

Then I decided to give Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. a chance. I like Joss Whedon's older television projects.

I'm still in the first half of the first season, and I read that people say the first season isn't as good as the rest. And that it started to get a bit better with the second half of the first season.

But then I don't understand the user ratings for the episodes of season 1: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/ratings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2364582/ratings) (scroll down to “Ratings by episode”)

Are the good ratings due to fans rewatching the show over and over again, putting the first episodes in the context of the later episodes they already know?

I enjoyed other shows and movies with a below 7.5 rating, especially if they are in a genre I like. But I wouldn't give the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode I watched more than 5 bis 6 stars.

**Is this just a sign that the show isn't for me, or are the ratings not reflecting the real quality?**

The show always starts out interesting with 50 minutes of content in the beginning, but start to wane when it comes to the third episode or so. Plot threads start to feel rushed and by the finale, you leave unsatisfied. 

That’s the way I feel with Secret Invasion. What was the point of the 200+ million budget if we get a bunch of half-assed action scenes and cheap looking sets? Why are there still plot threads unresolved and leaving you with more questions than answers by the end of the series? I don’t feel satisfied watching these shows like I did with the Netflix shows or even AoS. I think that Marvel needs to take a step back, and hire some quality writers. Stop rushing things to put out content. I honestly wouldn’t mind less shows and movies per year as long as what we got was of quality. After Ant-Man 3 and this show, I’m starting to feel the toll of bland nothingburgers we’ve been getting in this Phase. I’m cautiously optimistic for Daredevil because it’s 18 episodes with arcs, but since the writers strike has delayed it, we still might be getting poor quality. 

The only good thing I’ve seen Marvel do was delay The Marvels to November. If it means better writing and CGI, I’m all for it. I just want to see the excitement and hype I had for the MCU prior to Endgame. I hope Marvel learns from this and starts to take these projects more seriously from now on."

So I'm sure that many of us must have (at least once) received the notification that the post was removed due to ""low efforts"" or maybe since the title ""wasn't long enough"". I was hoping maybe we can have at least an hour's window so that our posts can stay.

Assuming that it still isn't receiving that reception it should then the posts can be removed since I'm sure that people do try to post but even the slightest of effort is gone away in a literal less than a second when we receive the notification from a bot.

Also I think that Bot isn't the best judge for a post so I'd request the moderators to look into the post themselves. I can understand that finding space in the schedule would be difficult but honestly when so many conversations have gone around AI recently, I think that moderators judgement would be fairer.

Secret Invasion has taken the mantle of shortest MCU show so far, coming in 10 minutes and 10 seconds shorter than She-Hulk.

The average viewers, those non-MCU fans who happily turned up to see Endgame in droves, didn't even bother to watch a single episode of those show and viewership is bad.

Because of these two things the show is unprofitable.

Bob Iger was already saying prior to the SI premiere that they should cut back on the number of MCU projects because the quality has declined and viewership has declined.

So the more unprofitable MCU content like SI there is, the less willing Disney is going to be to green light future projects.

So I don't quite understand why people who identify as MCU fans are arguing that shows like Secret Invasion ""are just fine and they don't need to be good""

They need to be good otherwise not enough people will watch them to make them profitable.

Why would you argue for more of something that threatens to shrink the MCU you claim to love so much?

It makes no sense.

The whole multiverse stuff as a whole has felt lazy too.

Why are some characters different looking than others? How does it even really all work considering it feels like multiple different movies or shows express it in a different light or way? There’s no buildup, or understanding of it.

How I Wish the Secret Invasion Finale Went - Spoilers,Opaug25,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bhhy0/how_i_wish_the_secret_invasion_finale_went/,1690501785.0,"If the writers had changed a few concepts, I feel it would have greatly improved the finale and series in general. 

First, I would have swapped G'iah's role with Fury's.  If Fury went to see Gravik instead of the president, there could have been some great scenes.  The Harvest should have ""overdosed"" Gravik.  While Gravik realized his hubris was his undoing, Fury with his dying words could have said he kept The Harvest from him to protect him, and once he understood Gravik was beyond redemption, he decided to give in to him.

Fury knowing meeting Gravik would be a suicide mission, he would have G'iah take on his form and rescue the president.  Maybe Fury could have went into the memory machine to transfer his memories to G'iah.  Fury, wanting to redeem his friend Talos and give G'iah an opportunity to redeem him as well, could take on Fury's form to better position herself to lead the Skrulls to a new home.  Skrulls still have respect for Fury, so they would likely follow him over G'iah.  If G'iah assumes his form indefinitely, and Fury takes on Gravik, no one would know the difference as Fury would have died from radioactivity. 

G'iah could let Priscilla/Varra know about Fury and they could work together to protect and lead the Skrulls.  Perhaps G'iah could still work with Sonya, but under the form of Fury without her knowledge that she's G'iah.  G'iah would never have been injected with the Avenger DNA and would retain her healing powers - which I thought giving her all those powers was bad writing as well.

At any rate, I've always defended MCU projects, but this one left me really disappointed.  "

A version of Kang already lost in Quantumania, they already knew that he would have a slightly fragile image,
now they need to show just how powerful he can be. How to show that he can beat anyone individually regardless of power? Make it by killing someone who has all the powers.

The issue is Secret Wars was *bad*, so the plot twist of Rhodey being Skrull for that long feels bad , cause why’d it have to be revealed in such an all around disappointing show.

Another thing I tried to bring to this was the movie experience. If you watch this you can happily skip to the 18 minute marker. But if your insane like me and want to see a samuel l jackson themed intro credits the press play and enjoy the ride.

What if Vision shot down Tony Stark instead of James Rhodes? [CACW],dmreif,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bjtxj/what_if_vision_shot_down_tony_stark_instead_of/,1690508206.0,"Put it simply, how would the final act of *Captain America: Civil War* have played out if Tony was injured instead of Rhodey? Let's say the airport battle  was the same up until Rhodey orders Vision to fire on Sam. When Vision fires, Sam dodges, but instead of Rhodey, it's Tony gets hit. Tony falls to Earth and is  paralyzed, like Rhodey is in the film. From here, I think there's two ways this would play out:

**Scenario A: Jailbreak**

Clint, Sam, Scott, and Wanda are captured and taken to the Raft while Rhodey and Vision accompany Tony to the hospital. While Tony is in surgery, Rhodey feels very guilty and ashamed. He blames himself for Tony's injuries. He was, after all, the one who ordered Vision to fire on Sam. He also is horrified by the results, because if Vision's beam could take out Tony's arc reactor, it probably would've destroyed Sam's jetpack and maybe killed him in the air. He has his interaction with Natasha, and then he gets the information from the authorities about Zemo and about Bucky being framed.

Rhodey, Natasha and Vision decide to visit the Raft to get information on Zemo and the HYDRA base from the captured members of Team Cap, and to give this information to Ross. When they get there, though, they take an instant dislike to how Team Cap are being treated. Vision is appalled and sickened by the sight of Wanda in a straitjacket and shock collar, and protests to Ross, ""You can't do that! It's illegal!"" to which Ross probably just retorts, ""Listen, Wonder Man,  I give the orders here. I determine the protocols."" Vision isn't having it. He punches Ross out, and goes down to free Wanda, while Rhodey and Natasha go to the cells where Clint, Scott, and Sam are being held. They go to Sam, and persuade him to give him the information on the HYDRA base. Sam does so, but by that point, Vision comes in with a freed Wanda. They decide to free Sam, Clint, and Scott, and after a fight scene with the Raft guards, they get on the Quinjet, and fly to Siberia to meet up with Steve and Bucky.

**Scenario B: Medical Aid**

When Tony hits the ground, Sam goes to work. Unlike Tony, Rhodey has the common sense to realize that at this point, someone being grievously injured is more important than being divided by the Accords, so helps Sam do his job. During this time, Vision flies over with Wanda. Wanda's still a bit out of it from Rhodey using a sonic cannon on her earlier, and still pissed at Rhodey for that and for Tony firing missiles at her, but she also elects to assist Sam. Actually, she ends up being useful in that her powers allow her to rip off Tony's suit off to make things easier for Sam. While they're doing this, Sam and Wanda are able to talk things out with Natasha, Rhodey and Vision about what's going on with the threat of Zemo and the Winter Soldiers, during which Wanda also vents over Tony interning her in the compound (both of these things strike a nerve with Rhodey).

Understanding the threat that Zemo poses, Rhodey decides that stopping Zemo and the Winter Soldiers is more important than enforcing the Accords, and that Tony might very well have just doomed the world by choosing to start this fight over a bruised ego. Once Rhodey and Sam have ensured that Tony is stabilized, they, plus Wanda, Clint and Scott convince T'Challa to fly them to Siberia in his plane, and take Natasha and Vision with them. This group of Rhodey, T'Challa, Natasha, Sam, Clint, Scott, Wanda, and Vision then meets up with Steve and Bucky before they can enter the HYDRA base.

**Both Scenarios**

In both scenarios, Zemo ends up electing not to kill the Winter Soldiers. Instead, he sets them loose, and the Avengers end up having to battle all five of them. After a drawn out battle, they kill the Winter Soldiers and capture Zemo.  They then use Zemo as a bargaining chip to get Ross to not pursue charges against them, probably by pointing out how it would look terrible to Ross to arrest them when they just saved the world  again, and also because the way things played out show that if they'd been bound by the Accords, they'd have been prevented from stopping Zemo in time. (As a bonus, Wanda uses her telepathy to convince Ross to start investigating Tony for his involvement in Ultron's creation, and to blame the airport battle solely on Tony as well.) The UN are also forced to strike down the Accords in light of reports about what happened in Siberia.

And another big reason the Accords are struck down is because these reports on what happened reflect terribly on...Tony Stark. The fight, the airport getting trashed, and getting crippled, those are all Tony's fault because he decided not to listen to Steve's attempts to explain the situation and the threat that Zemo posed. The rest of Team Iron Man (Rhodey, Vision and Natasha) showed a willingness to work with those opposing the Accords to stop this threat, but it required Tony to be out of commission for them to successfully talk things out. 

The upside is that Team Cap would be the moral victors in this conflict, with those who fought on Tony's side being forced to admit that they were wrong for trying to stop Team Cap from saving the world."

Detailed files were kept on them instead.

Yea this would have killed Rhodes and Ross but so what? You lose one future project in Armor Wars, but have the opportunity to throw some true chaos into the MCU. If it was revealed that Rhodes was actually dead since say civil war it may have been interesting. Now it doesn't really matter when he was replaced since he's basically fine now and nothing he did was out of character except for in the show. So it doesn't matter when he was replaced or anyone else for the most part.

 If all the people were killed when replaced you would now have multiple characters and world leaders now gone which would make things far more interesting for the next captain america movie and the general world dynamic going forward.

I was so excited they had a platform they could use to give us more fully fleshed out stories and be able to give the fans explanations to “how come this happened?” or “where was so and so this whole time?” But it’s not being what it could or should be. 

Now, I completely understand that we are still in early phases leading up to Secret Wars (which at this point, who knows if that’s this eras endgame). 

The only show out of all of them that got away with these runtimes was WandaVision and that was so very specific to the groundbreaking storytelling that was. Even those 20 some minutes episodes were necessary. 

But these other projects.. the whole point was to be able to have HBO/NETFLIX level quality in storytelling!!! When we have all these wonky runtimes parts of the story aren’t hitting at the right points in time, plot that’s supposed to happen at the 20 minute mark or whatever time are getting LOST or not even addressed. 

Please Marvel Studios TAKE THE TIME.. give us the full hour long serials. We want to give these shows the respect they got hyped up for. And it’s not even about the hype, it’s about respect to all the groundwork that was laid out before!  

Like how could we respect and be excited about a show worried about finding a new home for Skrulls when , hello? did they not think Asgardians share earth and not even MENTION it.

1. Most of the final episode. All the Skrulls disappeared from the compound with barely an explanation. The underwhelming hospital shootout apropos of nothing. The President's sudden villain turn.
2. The very concept of Skrull infiltration seems to get largely dropped after episode 3.
3. I suspect Olivia Colman's interrogation scene might have been added in reshoots after they recognized she was a breakout character. It didn't make sense that someone so high up was going in alone and she didn't interact with any main characters for the whole sequence.
4. Talos talks about winning the humans' trust, dies saving the President, and then none of this is followed up on.
5. The abrupt ending to the motorcade shootout. Gravik's right hand man teleports in with a motorcycle while all the British soldiers around Gravik vanish.
6. The rebellion against Gravik didn't seem to serve any story purpose.
7. The truncated runtimes after the first 2 episodes suggests heavy cuts."

\- after events of Captain Marcel handful of Skrulls end up on Earth(guess the ending scene of Captain Marvel must be ignored like some other ending/post credit scenes in the past)

\- Furry formed up his team with most of them (maybe all of them or the few spare ones was just minding their business in human form like Vara did later)

\- Fury promised them a new world to live on but kind of 'forgot' about this promise BUT since they were working together and have some kind of purpose they did not rebel + Talos was advocating for Fury 100%

\- after the snap things went sideways and Talos started to lose his leadership, the Skrull council was (re)formed and tried to/took more power in general

\-after the blip Fury wasn't a role model anymore and him leaving again for the Sabre was enough for the Council to remove Talos from decision making - I guess on that point(or after the snap itself) Skrulls started to take humans places in various organisations. Maybe the idea was to rule Earth peacefully and create a save heaven for shapeshifters somewhere on the Earth but Gravik opposed that as a radical and preferred full out war and annihilation of humans

\- when Fury was gone Talos sent a signal to all the other Skrulls out there to come to Earth and those Skrulls joined different factions working by different methods

\- then we have Secret Invasion events

Secret Invasion fumbled the fact that Captain Marvel was set in the 90s.,meme_abstinent,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bgnk6/secret_invasion_fumbled_the_fact_that_captain/,1690499594.0,"This argument stems from my opinion that Rhodey should have been a Skrull the entire time.

Why set Captain Marvel in the 90s? Fury meets Carol, learns about aliens and names the Avengers after her call-sign, these are all payoffs for making the movie a prequel. But these payoffs are shallow.

It’s the same as explaining why Han calls Chewbaka Chewy. Because his name is too long. Sometimes an ambiguous backstory is just as enthralling as knowing the grizzly details, and sometimes you learn you could’ve gone without knowing (Goose taking Fury’s eye) but we are getting off track.

I thought that by introducing Skrulls to Earth in the 90s and a couple years later announcing Secret Invasion, that that would mean for decades the Skrulls have been planning this, a true espionage situation.

Shoot Winter Soldier handled the passage of time like this. Even Black Widow acknowledged that the decades that had past since Ohio shifted where our characters were and power dynamics. 

But Secret Invasion doesn’t do this with its main selling point.

Rhodey was a perfect candidate for being a Skrull the entire time. He has little to no characterization outside of “military man who is Tony Stark’s best friend” and they could have used his lack of characterization as a strength here, but instead they didn’t. And even worse, they may rob him of his most significant moments if he has been a Skrull since Civil War. If he’s been a Skrull since FatWS then what the fuck was the point? What kind of consequences are those? That’s pussy storytelling."

I didn’t like the thing myself, but treating it as this final nail in the coffin for the MCU as I’ve seen some people have been is a little bit too far IMO. I still believe that Marvel has a bright future in the coming years, and I have faith that stuff like Loki S2, Cap 4 Deadpool 3, Thunderbolts, Daredevil, F4, Armor Wars, the next Avengers and even unannounced projects like Spider-Man 4 will all be great projects, we just need need a little patience.

The Promise and the Perils of a shared universe,futurific,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b6lb2/the_promise_and_the_perils_of_a_shared_universe/,1690475797.0,"The amazing thing the MCU brought to cinema was the promise that the characters you see in one film will continue on and may appear alongside other characters in other adventures.

That gets derided by a lot of people, some cinephiles especially, as soulless cash-grab IP monetization. (Ask those people if they feel the same way about Antoine Doinel showing up in five separate films by François Truffaut.)

But with that promise there is peril, and Secret Invasion shines a huge spotlight on exactly the problem.

**SPOILERS**

Marvel Studios has a huge problem now, and IMO it’s bigger than “doesn’t anyone notice the giant new rock formation that kind of looks like a head and a hand?”, or “why didn’t Hawkeye jump in to help Spider-Man at the Statue of Liberty?”

I do believe our suspension of disbelief can stretch that far.

But it absolutely *breaks* if we’re expected to swallow that the President of the United States goes on air, announces shape-shifting aliens, declares war on all off-planet born species … and now Daredevil only really cares or talks about some shady land deal the Kingpin is making.

**Wishful Thinking Time**

In the vast multiverse of “what if?”, there’s a version of the MCU in which AVENGERS: SECRET WAR was the end of Phase 4, in which the movies and shows were planned out to drop hints of a Skrull terrorist cell, in which the movie begins with an assassination attempt BY FURY(!), in which the movie centers on Fury clearing his name and getting to the bottom of the conspiracy, in which we learned that many of those who “came back” after the Snap had died of natural causes and Skrulls saw an opportunity, in which the ending raises serious moral questions and sets the stage for Phase 5….

The only possible path for Ghaia in the MCU...,mikekrypton,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b9tjv/the_only_possible_path_for_ghaia_in_the_mcu/,1690483407.0,"Ok...just finished watching Secret Invasion. Here are my thoughts (the last thought relates to the post title):

(****WARNING...SPOILERS IN POST FOR FATWS AND SECRET INVASION)

you have been warned....

1) They should have had Sharon Carter be one of the humans being released from the containment. This would have paid off ""The Power Broker"" twist in FATWS. Even if it was hazy and in the background...it would have been really cool to catch this.

2) To connect it to the greater MCU, the show should have had a post-credit scene of Thadeus Ross (Ford) being the Vice President. 

3) I believe the only path for Ghaia is that, she herself, is The Superskrull (not Gravik) and will be a main villain in an upcoming Avengers movie. Why do you ask? a) she showed invisibility powers like the original Superskrull from the comics. Gravik did not. She kept forming a rock like arm (The Thing?). Also....she is soooooo powerful (I saw some Scarlet Witch and Captain Marvel in her fighting. This would make her either a) an extremely overpowered hero or b) A formidable villain needing multiple heroes to take down.

Just my thoughts. Big Fury fan, so I liked the show a lot. I don't think it did well because people are looking for their favorite heroes to pop up and save the day."

We won’t have much screen time left with Thor. I personally hope at the very least we get another movie and he is in the next two Avengers movies.

I think the temptation will be to kill him iff. Perhaps in some heroic sacrifice in a Avengers movie but I really hope they do not.

Killing off the character when an actor decides they no longer want to play the characters anymore or the actor might be getting a little long in the tooth seems to be the default. But I think a character like Thor who has lived hundreds of years to suddenly be killed off would not be satisfactory.

My hopes is they go down the All Father King Thor route where he goes back to a revived Asgard to rule and perhaps get married.

We got a rare happy ending with Captain America so something like that would be great and also keeps the door slightly ajar for cameos."
Are we done pretending the MCU hasn't had a fall off in terms of writing?,Moody_skip65w,356,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a5uvi/are_we_done_pretending_the_mcu_hasnt_had_a_fall/,1690377973.0,"With the recent criticism over the finale of Secret Invasion, I think a good portion of the fanbase has finally opened their eyes to the drop off in quality of the writing.

Don't get me wrong, there have been some projects I have loved so far ( Loki, Ms Marvel, Gotg 3). But it really seems like the writing has been getting progressively worse with each project that has been released. 

Sure, the infinity saga has had its fair share of bad writing, but the impact of it in the grand scheme of the MCU wasn't even close compared to now. A movie like Quantumania having bad writing is really going to hurt how people view the multiverse saga, due to it failing to make the main antagonist of the saga feel dangerous. 

Why should we be scared of a villain who lost to an army of ants? Hell, the council of Kangs looks like a complete fucking joke when shown in the post credit scene. 

The MCU really can't afford this trend of bad writing to continue. Especially in projects that are the cornerstone of the multiverse saga."

&gt;Maria Hill dead was awful, post blip, post being a SHIELd agent killed like this by gravik in a event like this just for shock value, and setting up Fury motivation, in a series where many of the character arent memorabile like That, a old run character like her, with actress like Cobie Smulders 
Would have nade the series much better instead of 
... That. 
&gt;the main premise of the series ""you dont know who you can trust "" Is absolutely false since we Know since ep 2 everyone who is Skrull and which no 

&gt;Nick Fury character assassination: this series didnt  help Fury character at all, instead made everything about him worse.
He is not the self made spy we always loved, instead  he is JUST an opportunist who found his ass in 95 meeting the skrulls, who if it weren't for them he would still be in that office, 
who therefore made a career only by manipulating immigrants into doing his job. who, moreover, is also a fool who hasn't even checked them and how much people they bringed, 
For most of the series he is doing random stuff that is far away from the plan anf at the end he doesnt even have the confrontation with the villain who created almost all the mess by himself, and at the end of the series after creating the moment of political tension where Skrulls and humans are being killed .. he goes back to space.. 

&gt;Retcons after Retcons

&gt;the Skrulls have always been here, have always insert themself in every Major political career to practically build furry career. 
So good they never even find Hydra infiltration into the Shield. 
In that occassion Fury even had to fake his death 

&gt;The series has an horrible pacing: in some longer episodes it doesnt happen Anything, in shorter ones it happens too much stuff that you Can't even focus on. 
It seem that the idea of spy thriller is slow pacing, people talking for run time and run time and sometimes expplosions . 

&gt;like i bet with my friends, the table of the skrulls, with the UK prime minister, The Nato leader. And then others will Be never seen again, not the human, them. 
Because it wasnt a scene to place in episode 2,because when the guy wants to make a f cking world war and he has the NATO leader the series should ve f cking done. 

&gt; Fury wife character is useless and add absolutely nothing outside of tryng to make Fury more likeable after make the unthinkable with his reputation 

&gt;the military and socio political stuff in this series was so underwheling and Inc accurate, if you Want to make a realistic something you need to inform yourself 
A writing room that doesnt know how to write court rooms in a court room comedy, a writing room that doesnt know how to write spy thriller in a spy thriller 
I dont  know, an Agatha series with someone that doesnt know how to write basic magic stuff is the next step 

&gt;all charaxters are bland, New and old ones, male or female it doesnt matter 

&gt;the only less bland character Talos has anti climatic death that the series it self doesnt care about, instead of pksyng for sone minutes just for cheap emotional shock that doesnt land

The series make it that the Skrull are pissed because in 30 Years that they are here ( also we Are in 2025 right?) 
And now Gravik has made a rebels of them 
And want to cause a world war 3 to destroy humanity and take the planet

But 1,what they really have to complain ?  I get It, they are working for a guy who isnt giving them a planet. 
But they are living well,in peace,and was fine lally no one noticed before some started doing terrorist attacks. 
They can eat human food, they have no problems stay in human shapes, 
If they had problems doing some of that, after 30 Years it would have made sense their backlash but no, 
They even bring 1 million of them without Fury or anyone else noticing it
The table of skrulls wants to leave in peace (expect the woman who i dont remember who she was) wants who still live they always did 
Gravik recruit some runway radicalized
But they shoudnt be this menace 

I get that Fury is the nearest to take It Out.
 But damn they should be pissed more at Captain  Marvel, she was lite rally the one who take some of them away to search a planet
She is the one they should be mad. 

Gravitk plan doesnt make sense, 
And is clear that change from episode to episode for writing reasons 

His plan (at the start) is  a conflict between America and Russia that lead to world war 3 

Also, an atomic bomb isnt juat radiation is You know, the bomb, that disintegrates you, so yeah he should be worried about his people getting killed in process, if he doesnt find a place where 1million people can not be affected. 
But again, they also eats human food, vegetale and meat, they need some place to find this stuff 
Gravik plan leads to make the planet inabitable. 


because he is apparently the only ome who can stop then 

rom episode 1 the important thing is killing Nick Fury, he want Nick Fury death, he makes ""Rhodney"" Obbligate his wife to do It 


Then the plan is retconned to ""no i need Nick Fury alive for the Harvest,thats why i didnt killed him"" 
When in the same episode he sent people to kill Varra because she didnt Obey him and killed Fury

The harvest thing make sense in the prospettive that ""Fury"" gives him in the ending, using the power to find a planet ecc. 
But is kinda useless to him in his world war 3 plan, 
It makes sense with the critics i made before 

Since    he can weap out humanity without destroyer the planet.. But is never acknoledge!

Most Marvel projects have a central theme that ties things together.  Wanda Vision dealt with grief.  Falcon and the Winter Soldier dealt with idol and symbol.  Loki dealt with loving oneself.  etc.  They might not always present the theme well, but they had one.  What was Secret Invasions'?

Not to say there WEREN'T any ideas.  On the contrary, I found many views captivating.

-Skrull Chairperson's ""We did not end up homeless refugees because we were unwilling to wage war.  We ended up homeless refugees because we were too willing.""

-Rhodes' ""The reason we wrestled this power from mediocre men who don't look like us, was not to simply to turn around and hand it to mediocre men who do.""

-Gravik's ""The difference between statesmen and soldiers...""

-Fury's ""Human can't coexist with each other  ...  There is not enough room or tolerance on this planet for another species.""

However, I struggle to see a unifying perspective that is core in the show.  Everyone complained that Fury abandoned them, and the show ends with Fury abandoning them again.  Is there a clever way to read this?"

"As someone who read the Secret Invasion storyline in the comics, the miniseries was sadly underwhelming",staplerbot,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15bawdl/as_someone_who_read_the_secret_invasion_storyline/,1690485960.0,"Just to preface this, I didn't hate it. I thought it was okay, with some bright spots, mainly the performances by Sam Jackson, Olivia Coleman and Ben Mendelsohn. I even kind of liked the big dumb Super Skrull fight at the end. However, the storyline in the comics is very expansive, to the point where they could have potentially built up a small phase of the MCU leading into an Avengers: Secret Invasion film.


In the comics, it turns out that many of the world's leaders as well as some major superheroes are revealed to be Skrulls and have been Skrulls for years. It's a startling revelation with major repercussions for the Marvel universe, including the disbandment of SHIELD leading to a replacement agency called HAMMER led by fucking Norman Osborne who then somehow acquires the legal rights to the Avengers, who he then leads (as Iron Patriot) and replaces all of the members with supervillains that still call themselves by the names of the superheroes (for example, Bullseye becomes Hawkeye, Mac Gargon/Venom becomes Spider-Man, Daken becomes Wolverine, etc.). This in turn leads into the Dark Avengers storyline which is what I was expecting the show to potentially lead into.


Just for further clarification, here's some of the major characters that are revealed to be Skrulls:

Hank Pym

Black Bolt

Elektra 

Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)

Jarvis, who is Tony Stark's human butler in the comics

Brother Voodoo

Mockingbird (who is married to Hawkeye in the comics)

Longshot

And then a bunch of Shield agents including Dum Dum Dugan and another person who I won't name in case they are revealed to be a Skrull later.


In the show, it's:


Rhodey

Everett Ross, I guess?


Just a waste of a weird and fun storyline in the comics. They really could have done something fun and interesting with it. Obviously they can't do the whole thing, but it's so watered down that it loses what made it fun in the first place. Civil War didn't resemble the comic version all that much, but at least they boiled it down to its essence, which was two factions that were both kind of right and wrong in their own way, led by Captain America and Iron Man. And it was still very interesting. This was just, there's some Skrulls in this and a few people turn out to be Skrulls and we're calling it Secret Invasion. A bit lazy when you take the source material into account."

So now that it's confirmed that James Rhodes was abducted by the Skrulls at the end of Civil War, let's see if Marvel maintains continuity by not having Rhodey say ""nice to see you"" and not """"nice to meet you"" when he sees Carol Danvers...

With that in mind, here's a definitive list of what Rhodey has missed.

&amp;#x200B;

What Rhodey Doesn’t Know:

* Best friend Tony Stark married Pepper, had a child and died. Ouch.
* Other friends, acquaintances and enemies Rhodey doesn’t know are dead are Steve Rogers, Black Widow, Loki (at least the prime one), Maria Hill
* The guy who accidentally paralyzed him, Vision, also dead (though there’s a white Vision hanging around somewhere)
* Rhodey never stood up against the Sokovia Accords. That was the skrull. 
* Scarlet Witch, who the whole Civil War was over between those who thought she couldn’t handle her power (like Rhodey) and those who didn’t. She proved to not be able to handle her power (Rhodey was right!) and is also dead after massacring many of the masters of the mystic arts and heroes in other universes.
* Speaking of mystic arts, Rhodey has never met Doctor Strange.
* Or Captain Marvel…
* Or any of the Guardians of the Galaxy and hasn’t yet remarked about a talking raccoon or formed a friendship with Nebula.
* Or Okoye, or Shuri.
* Or Valkyrie, or Korg
* Or Kate Bishop, or She-Hulk
* Or Shang-Chi, or the actual Mandarin
* Or Riri Williams, or Namor and the Talokanil
* Like much of the actual  general public, will slip his mind that the Eternals ever happened. 
* Never met Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine but reasonable to figure he knows her through her CIA work. 
* Thanos? What’s a Thanos?
* Natasha has a sister?
* Asgard is a city on Earth now?
* The blip? What’s that?  … On the other hand, he might find support in the support groups of people who lost five years of their lives.
* It’s Bucky! We have to stop him! Oh wait, he’s a good guy now?
* Never attended a ceremony where Sam Wilson have Cap’s shield to the U.S. government… And Wilson is Captain America now?
* Never been to Wakanda.
* Or to space.

While we’re at it, what about Everett Ross?

This one isn’t so complicated. He’s wearing what he wore at the end of Wakanda Forever so the only thing new to him would be Kang. "

2) The last time we saw Ross before the miniseries, it was implied he was taken back to Wakanda. The person who freed him was probably a Skrull

3) The show proves that the patriarchy sucks. As evidenced earlier in the episode where fake Rhodes tries to overpower one of the generals who felt like the attack wasn't too definitive. Also evidenced with Giah and Sonia, whose approach to helping each other are different from Fury and Talos and try to make up where both men failed. The women/new bloods were more progressive in their approach with better results.

Even Fury felt Varra needed ""saving"" but eventually admits that he himself needs help.

4) Ritson sucks. After averting one disaster, you create a similar one on your own soil. Even Fury himself tells Ritson that his tactics will land him ""one-term"" Imagine if this came out in 2017

5) The sins of Fury aren't fully justified. Even Gravick's story gives depth to his character. Taking the face of an unknown man with honor..."

While it would never be to that level, it could have been a lot closer if they would have added the Skrull element to each of the TV series. It could have been a sub plot in many, if not all, of the TV series, and it would allow the viewers to be more invested in the story arc and allow more prominent super heroes to be taken over by Skrulls. Instead, we have supposed to be all in on this secret invasion after 5, 30 min eps. and, minus War Machine, no super heroes taken."

So, for a while after the blip, there must have been people pointing out that there were impostors around.  Also, if a human blipped and not a skrull, would the skrull keep going, or would the skrull replace a human that blipped right in front of other people?

Things we really should point our about secret Invasion so Marvel knows what they did right,bill_buck,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15aofok/things_we_really_should_point_our_about_secret/,1690422282.0,"Things we really should point our about secret Invasion so Marvel knows what they did right

Obviously Secret Invasion was a pretty big letdown, especially eith these final 2 episodes. But there are honestly a couple great things that really should be pointed out, so we can hope marvel won't NOT do them in the future.

1. The Brutalness/violence
The pure violence in this show was honestly so great to see. Starting with the chopping off of a goddamn finger, this show was finally not gonna shy away from violence like other D+ specials, especially like in Moon Knight. People just straight up getting shot in the head, a whole Mortal Kombat on Peyton done by Gravik, etc. were just so good to see.

2. The acting
Obv this isn't really something Marvel can just ""shy away from"" but it's just good to note how good the acting was from everyone, but especially Sonya, Gravik, Fury, and Grava. 

3. The Writing
To be more specific, the writing for scenes just between 2 characters, or dialouge in general. Scenes like Skrodey and Fury at the diner, everything with Sonya, and scenes with Talos and literally anyone else were really just a treat to the eyes."
Multiverse saga,SolitudeShaman,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15au9t4/multiverse_saga/,1690440214.0,"So since we’re going into the multiverse saga, is the ultrom from what if gonna make an appearance in the main universe? 

Like do we only think that the big bad is Kang but in the end it’s going to wrap around to being the ultron from what if who made it to our reality? Is that a possible reason for them adding that new woman for season 2? She doesn’t exist in the mcu but is she going to become mcu canon when ultron finds a way to make to the mcu? 

Also, if he won’t end up being the overarching enemy, do you think he’ll at least team up with kang or maybe even help the avengers fight him in a surprise twist?"
Is Nick Fury Truly the Ultimate Spy in the MCU?,Anti_42,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15au6ms/is_nick_fury_truly_the_ultimate_spy_in_the_mcu/,1690439913.0," 

I mean, when Captain America: The Winter Soldier was written, they probably didn't even have the Skrulls in mind for the MCU. S.H.I.E.L.D. and the American government have been infiltrated not just once, but twice – first by Hydra, and then by the Skrulls!

It turns out Fury was using shapeshifting aliens for the past 30 years, making him one heck of a clever strategist to have such advanced assets. You'd think he'd be the best spy in the universe with those resources, right? But here's the kicker – even with all that, he couldn't foresee Hydra's takeover. It's baffling that none of his Skrull spies were able to sniff out Hydra's infiltration.

I have to admit, the show was kind of a letdown, and it did make Fury look a lot worse in my eyes. "

In the next entry Thor has to fight against his own variants because they, like him, tries to save their own universes. The Thor who remains then reaches Chronopolis and meets Loki and Sylvie. They fight and Thor finally puts an end to Loki's schemes. He then rebuilds the TVA and creates a new sacred timeline."

G’iah’s Powers,supernatlove,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b6mox/giahs_powers/,1690475891.0,"So Carol’s powers make most of the other Avengers DNA pretty redundant, but I was trying to figure out her potential power set.

Captain Marvel - Flight, Super Strength, Invulnerability, Power Blasts

Spider-Man - The Peter Tingle

Mantis - Mind Control

Groot- Limb extension 

Those are the ones for sure and the rest were pretty redundant. I did come up with a couple of other possibilities though.

Doctor Strange - Magic if she trains or gains access to the memories of someone who has

Thor - Maybe she can do lightning stuff kind of depends on how much that comes from Thor’s God Status

Hulk - Maybe getting angrier will further strengthen her

Star-Lord - Celestial DNA could maybe do something

Ebony Maw - Telekinesis (put him down here because I wasn’t sure if would’ve been included or not)

I don’t think anyone’s super intelligence is tied to their powers so that shouldn’t be on the table.

"Fury, you’re a problem",DCangst,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b6dev/fury_youre_a_problem/,1690475265.0,"I enjoyed the first part of Secret Invasion… but that finale was the dumbest thing I have seen for marvel in a long time. Even throughout the series, Fury was just doing stupid things. 

When he shot Gavick in the head, for example, and saw that he had Extremis, why stop? Go for a few more head shots.  I thought for sure he’d go round up, whatever Extremis cure Tony had figured out after that.

His repeated refusals to bring in any of the “special people” made no sense. I realize this was a plot device, but I feel like they could’ve come up with something better. It made no sense, for example, in hindsight that he never called Danvers during the battle for New York. I think that qualified as an emergency. I do realize of course captain Marvel hadn’t been made yet. So…it’s just a side note that ties into this decision in a retroactive way.

But here the entire planet is at stake and he says he hast to do this on his own because he can’t rely on them every time something like this happens. It’s the entire planet at stake.  THAT’S WHAT THEY ARE FOR!!!

There were many people he could have called him. One of the Hulks. Hell, Bucky Barnes would have been a logical resource. He’s got super strength and decades of stealth ops. I’d be more resistant to radiation. He could’ve snuck into the complex unseen and taken out Gavick.

I won’t even go into the absurdity of theories decision to handover Avenger DNA, allowing a virtually indestructible creation ( either way) and leaving the entire fate of the world and all human life on it up to the outcome of a fist fight. 

And the scene with the president, theory, and the SIS lady, trying to convince the president that Rhodes was a Skrull when World War III was imminent. Shoot him, cut off a pinky, or hell just pull down his pants. 😂

There was just so much more here but it would be a dissertation.  Even the whole avenger DNA thing made no sense from multiple angles. It’s a shame because I was actually enjoying the series until about the last couple of episodes.

Fury makes bad decisions. He puts the world in jeopardy and creates problems. The whole Skrull thing WAS his fault."

We'll likely see the consequences influence several upcoming projects:

1. Captain America New World Order: Sam is the new Cap, but he seems to be still part of the US military hierarchy. Ritson may try to order him to spearhead and be the face of this war against the Skrulls, so maybe we'll see Sam go through the same internal conflicts Steve faced, about serving the country as Cap vs defying government orders he deems wrong?
2. Secret Wars: In short, the wartime adventures of Sonia &amp; Gi'ah. The USA is being stupid, so the British revokes their independence and wants their colony back /jk
3. Armour Wars: Maybe this will be Rhodey's ""coming out of the ice"" story, coming to terms with what he missed out, how the world has changed, and struggling with the government's recent decisions and current trajectory while also coming to terms with his personal stance towards the Skrulls. Ironheart is proof that human technology has finally progressed enough for other geniuses to independently reproduce Iron Man-like suits, so maybe the US military had secretly reversed engineered War Machine's suit, setting the foundations for Rhodey's character arc in this movie.

Honestly I haven't heard new info about these other movies ever since they were first announced, so the above is pure speculation based on Secret Invasion's finale alone. Will be interesting how the US-Skrull not-so-secret war will fit into the multiverse. Lowkey hoping the British will really recolonise the Americans tho lmao

PS: maybe the SABER space station — humanity's most advanced aerospace defence system — will be the setting for a certain aerospace engineer and his team of 4 to be exposed to some cosmic radiation event…? "

One of the biggest problem of Marvel is that the budget for their projects is way too high,MCUFanFicWriter,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b4dyp/one_of_the_biggest_problem_of_marvel_is_that_the/,1690470557.0,"



Marvel (and Disney in general) clearly has a budgeting problem, as stated by Bob Iger.

Marvel's approach might have worked for a long time, but now they are clearly struggling. 

Their big budgets give them the luxery to do reshoots over and over again and to ""fix everything in post"".

One of the main problems is, however, that the scrips are often rushed. Sometimes the scrips aren't even finished before shooting. 

Having a strong script is incredibly important to get a good final product.

That's why James Gunn's movies are so strong: he is a storyteller first and foremost and makes sure his script is basically set in stone.

Another problem is of course the VFX. VFX workers are overworked because Marvel keeps changing and changing stuff (especially their producers, like Feige) until the last minute.


Lesser budgets would force them to plan their stuff better and would force film makers to be more creative. The studio needs to get their vision straight before they start shooting."

First of all, you could of course read the comics, if you want the true OG Secret Invasion experience. 

But if you want to see the skrull invasion in tv form, them you can watch season 2 of the animated show Avengers: Earth Mightiest heroes, which adapted that whole storyline from the comics quite well. 

But if you want a live action show from Marvel with Nick fury in it, then fear not because Agents of Shield had an arc in season 4 which tackles the whole ""who can you trust"", ""people who look like your friends"" etc, and it did it say better then Secret Invasion, even though that was just one arc and Secret Invasions whole premise was that. 

So there's some suggestions, do you guys have any more?"

Instead he declares an all-out war against the Skrulls on Earth, and Ross will take over after him, and is this war even being brought up again in Brave New World? But that would also suggest they have a plan for all of this and IDK anymore.

Also a minor complaint, I hate how they never gave Ritson a first name.

MCU in it’s current state and future prospects,axe2024,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ago0g/mcu_in_its_current_state_and_future_prospects/,1690402998.0,"TLDR: So, realistically speaking, at what point is “quality” MCU as a WHOLE supposed to begin airing? 

We’ve had a pandemic and this rush of announcements post end-game during the pandemic for phases 4-5-6. She-Hulk clearly acknowledged Marvel’s formulaic plot structure suggesting that at least Marvel is aware of the cgi slugfest problems and predictable storylines. We had the vfx community openly denounce Disney and the larger content rush. And just prior to the SAG strike, Iger admits that Disney+ has diluted the quality of the MCU brand.

It feels safe to say that at the very least Marvel content is mixed in quality but at an all time low with regards to public reception.

I was hoping that with the announcement that Phase 4 ends with BP:WF, that Phase 5 would be beginning of the quality MCU again. But so far we’ve had a mixed bag &gt;!(2 flops and 1 hit)!&lt;.

It seems safe to infer that everything in post-production now may still suffer from the (post-)pandemic, vfx, and over saturated MCU mess we are currently in (I view the strikes as something that I hope will improve future MCU content). Does this realistically mean we shouldn’t really expect a majority of MCU quality except for the content in pre-production? I know little regarding how movies/tv-shows are made. But I’d imagine that by the filming stage, it’s largely difficult to fix core problems with the content if say something like the story/writing is lackluster.

So looking at the current pipeline, the earliest MCU projects that have not begun filming are Thunderbolts, Blade, and F4. So back to my initial question, does this mean that we shouldn’t really expect the “quality” MCU content until the very earliest, Thunderbolts?

Provision: I am not suggesting that items currently in production/post-production cannot be good. I am more suggesting that these same products will still largely suffer from potentially poor writing, rushed schedule, etc.

Personal aside: So with the upcoming MCU projects that are filming or in post, here are the projects that I hope and expect to be good: Loki Season 2, X-Men 97, What If…? season 2, Deadpool 3

What I expect to be bad but I hope will be good: The Marvels, Echo, Ironheart, Agatha, Daredevil: Born Again, CA:BNW"

1. Who is the audience for this?  
2. Will this be profitable on its own?
3. If not, how will this assist in other profits?
4. Is it necessary to the larger story?

So let's compare and contrast *Moon Knight* versus *Ms. Marvel.*

*Moon Knight*:

1. The audience is comic fans who know this B-tier character and those who will watch anything marvel.  Also Oscar Isaac fans.
2. Nope. On a streamer, no direct profits.
3. May or may not be a reason people subscribed to Disney+
4. Did not establish any solid ties to MCU that require future use of this character.  Does not lead to anything yet.

*Ms. Marvel*:

1. In addition to MCU fans generally, and fans of the comic (which I also consider a B-tier character), it expands the reach into the Pakistani and Indian communities; this character opens a market.
2. Nope; again, no direct profits tied to a streaming show.
3. This is where the magic happens; with the large popularity and the direct lead-in to *The Marvels*,  this was basically both entertainment and a $200M lead-in property to a large franchise film.  So this helps profits in 2 ways ... it increases Disney+ profits by making it required viewing for before the movie, and hopefully hooks more people into the movie in general release.
4. Well, it appears to be ... it at least becomes important for one big movie, and is bringing in multiple characters they intend to use (I hope) a lot.

Did I like *Moon Knight*?  Absolutely.  But it didn't pull its weight with the MCU ... minimal acknowledgment of MCU relevance and a self-contained story ... It didn't try for the heavy lifting that *Ms. Marvel* accomplished."

That finale had to have been one of the worst things I have ever witnessed. It felt like the show had no passion or effort put into it and felt somewhat rushed.

Now, if you understand the history of the Inhumans even a little, you understand why I might suggest this. Bringing in the Inhumans during this period of &gt;! maximum alien hostility !&lt; sets them up as the individuals to be hated and feared by the populace from outside humanity. Following this, I think the X-Men would have an even stronger entry into the world.

There's one of two ways the X-Men get set up in the MCU. Either they're the premier version of the School for Gifted Youngsters and we get the story of all the X-people growing up in the mansion, or the MCU decides to do things the hard way and implement Hickman's Krakoa Era as the foundation. Either one works here. I'm doing a lot of theory-writing, but I'm basically saying now is a good time for the Inhumans to pop up, and then subsequently, the X-Men can show up after &gt;! substantial doubt has been shown about what exactly can be classified as alien !&lt;.

I’m a little shocked that the general consensus seems to be that Secret Invasion was bad. Sure, it could’ve been much better, and it did seem like too large of a comic storyline to just have a couple characters and episodes. But I thought that it overall was enjoyable to watch, and I had a good time with it. 

I also really enjoyed the “Rhodey” stuff. I know it will upset some people that he has been a skrull for some time now, probably before Endgame. But after thinking about it, it sounds interesting to see Rhodey actually deal with the fallout of Endgame (tony’s death, Armor Wars stuff), because it felt like he was sidelined for a while after being a main character. Hell, we’ve seen more of Happy’s trauma and thoughts than Rhodey’s. If done right, it could make for some great content. 

Secret Invasion felt different at the least than most other MCU shows/movies recently, even if it didn’t completely stick the landing.  

Am I weird for thinking this or do others agree? Thoughts?"
My Opinion on Secret Invasion,Frequent-Cost2184,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15au85z/my_opinion_on_secret_invasion/,1690440054.0,"Now, I would like to start this post by saying that I would’ve not posted this, if I didn’t see so many negative opinions abt the series especially the last episode which really came to me as a surprise. 

I would like to add that I am not some expert in movies, and not even a marvel expert, I am just a guy who watches MCU, and generally knows the characters, their backstories and follow it relatively closely.

I think that the show was great, did it have its flaws? Absolutely, ofc it did. One of them being for example that with Rhodey being an Avenger, he could’ve easily called them to Gravik. But this shouldn’t be a reason to say that the show is ass. Many of the complaints was that it was slow and the climax wasn’t coming as fast as ppl would’ve wanted, but I personally think it was ok, at the end of the day they were trying to explain about a long story of aliens creatures who worked for Fury for decades as spies and now suddenly they don’t like him, you need to slowly introduce/integrate them into the MCU. I also saw some say that this movie added nothing to the MCU, which is in my humble opinion is little bit, tiny bit wrong to say at least, the movie ends with that there is a war against all alien form on Earth, the president didn’t specify Skrulls only, so it did in fact added lot to the MCU, saying that Secret Invasion didn’t bring anything to the MCU is like saying Civil War didn’t bring anything to the MCU

Another complaint was abt the last episode being like a big fat L to this whole show, (insert fail trombone sound effect here) type stuff, which I also kinda disagree, movie ended on a very good note, we got Giah into the MCU and with her abilities she is a superb character(remember we going toward the battle against the army of Kangs)

Would like conclude on this, I would like to add at the end that, with this post I don’t mean to offend anyone, if u disagree that’s 100% fine and this why this post was made, to discuss a show"

As far as Armor Wars is concerned, a rejuvenated Rhodey/War Machine will team up with Riri Williams/Ironheart to take on a team of Ultrons. This team of Ultrons will be assembled to eliminate Skrulls on Earth. But some AI mess-up will end up them being a threat to everyone."

Like in 'Falcon and the Winter Soldier,' 'She-Hulk,' and 'Secret Invasion.' And honestly, it's cool when it's about species-based powers or those serum-induced ones, makes sense those could be passed on through blood. 

But what stumps me is when you think about powers like Ghost's. Is quantum-based, so how on earth do they get tangled up with blood? Sure, one could say these powers got themselves entangled at a quantum level, but I just can't buy that they can be copied through biological stuff.

Then there's Captain Marvel. Her power is all about cosmic energy from the Tesseract, so how does that connect to blood? And if you think about Wanda... If you cloned her, it's not like the clone would start throwing around Chaos magic instantly. Wanda had to learn that stuff, didn't she? ( Or maybe she didn't? I don't know, I haven't read the comics. )  


 The way I see it, these powers are more about what's happening outside the body than anything to do with blood or genes. Did I miss a memo, or are there others who feel the same?"

I did a rewatch of the entire MCU recently and while pretty much all of the casting is good to great, Downey Jr. is just in a league all on his own. Even in the ensemble crossovers or when he's basically a cameo it's just night and day compared the other leading men and women. I get that most of that is down to sheer technical experience and I notice some of the others namely Hemsworth, Holland, Stan and Mackie beginning to catch up; he still stands out among Academy darlings like Hopkins and Nyong'o. 

My particular favourite scenes that have stuck with me for years are the ""there is only the next mission""/""I shouldn't have survived"" scene where Pepper threatens to quit in Iron Man (2008), both the Charlie Spencer scenes in Civil War with his surviving mother and with the Avengers at the compound, with Fury in Clint's barn (also my favourite Sam Jackson Fury scene btw), the hilarious strapped to a bedframe threatening the guards scene in Iron Man 3 and so many others. 

I will say one of the weaker ones was in the first Avengers , but that's not due to Downey's performance I just felt that Tony in that movie was written just a _pinch_ out of character from his previous 2 appearances for the teamup movie arc to work well. Just a little bit. Not enough to ruin the movie or anything.. he was just a little more bullish especially in his first scenes. He was definitely narcissistic and arrogant from the previous two films but he wasn't bullish to the extent of the Whedon movie. It was a little like Cheadle's Rhodey was in the suit sometimes."
Its overstated how much green screen Marvel uses.

It's particularly impressive in Loki and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Even the background of the Quantum Realm was projected on the walls to give the actors a sense of being there."
About president Ritson,Traditional-Emu-2319,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a5f2d/about_president_ritson/,1690376877.0,"Why do you think that he betrayed the skulls? Was it because he was disappointed, that he didn't know that their was secretly skrull operatives in his government, or so it because he was scared of the threats of a skrull invasion actually happening on earth? Do you think is the reason why he was a one-term president in the MCU, why Harrison Ford aka former general Thunderbolt Ross become the new president of the United States in captain America 4: New world order? How much should it effected world politics in the MCU as a whole, since anti-skrull terrorists killed both prime minister of United Kingdom, and famous political new reporter, and even galactic politics of the marvels actually talk about it, since mostly going to be about captain marvel, Ms.marvel and Monica Rambeau?How do you want this to actually effected the whole MCU as a whole? 

Here where I think it could be:


1. That this could lead to another terrorist faction of skrulls that become sympathize to gravik beliefs of wiping out the humanity

2. Maybe that this could lead to all out war with skrulls and humans, that could lead to secret wars

3. Oh it just nothing, it will be passed off as nothing with just being a brief event of the history of marvel cinematic universe"
Secret invasion finale hot take,Markus2822,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15b1yk3/secret_invasion_finale_hot_take/,1690464608.0,"Is everyone insane with hating on the finale? It’s by far the best part of this show.

Now there’s absolutely some shitty things in the finale so I’ll address those first. Skrull Rhodeys trying to convince the president that it was Russia was hilariously bad “it’s Russia Mr president, it’s Russia she’s dumb it’s russia because I said so, she has a perfectly reasonable explanation but it’s russia kill them now!” That was one of the worst scenes in the mcu. 

And then them not actually telling us how long rhodey was a skrull for us complete bs, they literally ask how long have you been in there and then it gets a vague “a very long time” answer. Wtf is that? Fuck you tell me when. 

But the rest of the episode is goddamn amazing and fixes most of the issues with the show. 

Two super skrulls fighting having all of the mcu’s powers? That was freaking awesome! I saw some people complaining that it’s not accurate to super skrull in the comics and yea so? Neither is anything else in this show, not a single superhero (unless you count rhodey) is a skrull. 

Is it an arbitrary way to give them powers? Yes but do you think a tesseract explosion or radioactive spider bite isn’t, hell with cap didn’t they just randomly pick him because he seemed like a good dude. But this vial giving them powers is somehow more crazy? 

Not to mention that the writing with fury and his wife is great this episode. It makes perfect sense for her to not want to go with him but when he finally accepts her for who she is she is willing to forgive him and give him a second chance.

Plus this fixes the WORST issue with the whole show being that almost nothing happened in every episode at least until the end. This episode always has something going on and sets up a lot for the future, a super skrull that’s good, possibly bringing back a bad super skrull but that’s a little less likely, a skrull war/genocide, a peace treaty between the skrull and kree. 

Now the rest of the show was pretty rough. I wouldn’t be surprised if episodes 2-5 got the worst ratings but this episode? This one is definitely the best by a mile."

People's expectations and ridiculous theories werent met, and they are mad, yet again. People need to learn to enjoy and story and not try and predict every crazy wild idea. 

The ending is still leading to more and more stories that expand the MCU.

- Ritson is a straight up jerk that uses fear to spread hysteria and leads to innocent people being attacked (sounds familiar...)
- the UK now works with Giah and is one of, if not the strongest characters in the mcu
- Fury says peace talks have started with the kree......and WHO just happens to be in the very next movie of The Marvels? The kree and Fury
- the new Captain America movie is formally know as New World Order..... and it makes even more sense WHY.  Now that's its Brave New World it will be about combating the horrible, one term presidency, of Ritson and his stain on the world

This story isn't over, and like classic MCU,  it's leading to more MCU stories

Was it the biggest series in the world, no. But it had story aspects that spread through the entire MCU and it will be exciting to what it leads to"
List of Concrete Problems with Secret Invasion,pachakutiqoulson,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15arke6/list_of_concrete_problems_with_secret_invasion/,1690431386.0,"1. Marvel already did a tense spy-thriller with Nick Fury! And it made way more sense bc the question was a question of allegiance, something you can’t easily see, unlike skrulls who can just be injured or killed to reveal their true form. This concept was doomed from the start.

2. To makeke the concept even more doomed, it completely abandoned the comics storyline, which could’ve pulled in the second most popular character from Marvel TV.

3. Fury spends the whole time talking, very little spy stuff, literally 0 surprising skrull reveals

4. Killed off two popular characters who didn’t have huge parts in the MCU but were fan favorites anyway, who could’ve had a good future

5. No tension built up before revealing the super skrull machine, no interesting transformation scene, very little usage of actual super skrull powers

6. Make two characters insanely OP as the climax, breaking 15 years of precedent (how are Ghost’s powers a DNA thing? Or Captain Marvel’s? Isn’t Giah the most powerful being in the universe now? And Fury just lets her go?). Then make their fight under 5 minutes long before one kills the other. Gravik could’ve easily flew away, but didn’t. The whole thing is way too easy and convenient.

6a. The other half of the climax was stupid, Sonya could’ve easily killed Skrhodey for that whole time. 

7. Introduced too many new characters, we don’t care about any of them (we only like Sonia bc of Colman’s acting, not story reasons). This story should’ve been told with skrulls messing with our favorite characters. 

8. ***Killing the bad guy actually doesn’t resolve the plot…. where are the rest of the skrulls? Seems like Fury just abandoned them. He didn’t even tell the President that a Skrull saved the day! Not satisfying at all.*** definitely no moral message or lesson learned here.

9. The villain is so shallow, 1-dimensional, and flat out stupid that it’s hard to stay engaged in the story. He could’ve killed Fury in the attack on the president and didn’t. He criticizes power-hungry humans and then immediately makes himself supreme skrull ruler. He kills his own people! It makes no sense!

10. So short! Yet somehow repetitive: 3 out of 6 episodes end with a death, 4 if you include gravik. And a lot of those problems could’ve been alleviated with more breathing room for the side characters, or side-plots built up with skrull-reveals later.

11. For Agents of SHIELD fans, it was a one-two punch: Fury didn’t call Coulson or Daisy, and the S4 LMD arc did this same thing 1000x better with a way smaller budget.

12. They showed us super interesting ideas in the last few minutes montage. Actual war between disguised skrulls and soldiers, confused vigilantes, general chaos, political tension, all could’ve been explored but were mitigated to 2 minutes at the end. 

Super disappointing for such a great comics arc. What else should be on the list?"
Why this saga feels disconnected,U2106_Later,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15ariyo/why_this_saga_feels_disconnected/,1690431272.0,"Honestly, I do get the criticism that things feel disconnected in these phases. Previous phases felt more tied together, if for nothing else than the fact that there were less projects to tie, period. With all of the new D+ shows, they needed to be more consistent and explicit. I think the studio has bit off more than they can chew with the amount of threads they are tackling.

&amp;#x200B;

Every project from phases 4 and 5 can basically be sorted into three categories: follow-ups, new stuff, and multiverse stuff.

Follow-ups are the projects that focus on the aftermath of the previous saga. I would say this includes Far From Home, TFatWS, WandaVision, Hawkeye, Secret Invasion, and Wakanda Forever. I'd also put Love and Thunder and the holiday special in this category. Here we have a consistent theme: addressing the consequences of the Blip, moving on from the deaths and loss of the previous films, and passing the torch to new heroes. To match this theme I'd throw She-Hulk in as well.

For new stuff, Ms. Marvel, Moon Knight, Echo, the Marvels, Born Again, Eternals, Shang-Chi, Ironheart, Blade, Fantastic Four. Eternals and Shang-Chi are kind of in-between this and the previous category since they both deal with Blip fallout.

Multiverse stuff is obvious: Loki, What If, MoM, Quantumania, and No Way Home. To me the biggest issue with this is that we don't have the in-between tissue for this and the second category (at least, not yet, but we should *already have it*)

&amp;#x200B;

They really should have sorted each category out into its own phase. I could see Phase 4 consisting of the projects in the follow-up category, perhaps concluding with WandaVision to tie it into the overarching saga, then start introducing more characters in Phase 5 as we branch out more into the universe. Transition into explicit multiverse stuff late in phase 5/entering phase 6. Throughout we can sprinkle in projects like Armor Wars, Guardians 3, etc. that don't necessarily connect to the main theme or introduce new ideas, but are good for rounding out the lineup. The nice thing is that since a lot of these films don't reference each other, they can probably be watched in any order, so a change to the viewing order can make it feel more cohesive.

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder if the plan was originally closer to this before the pandemic shifted things around."
Shorter duration of episodes is even more bothering than the general available quantity.,[deleted],8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a5gvj/shorter_duration_of_episodes_is_even_more/,1690377012.0,"While there have been complaints and criticisms regarding the six episodes structure, I believe that the duration of said episodes is also equally weakening the narrative.

It's been a common pattern from the start where episodes mostly have only been of half an hour to 40 minutes. Occasionally a few strech to 50 minutes and Hawkeye's last is the only that I can remember to have gone for a proper hour.

Not to forget that these shows are also just trying to adjust too much into a single season which remains half-baked and isn't entirely developed either. I personally feel that I can accept six episodes but it also needs to shorten the sub-plots enough that the season can adjust and have longer episodes. 

This is just a little piece and I'd like your insights on the same."

Marvel, that we should feel sorry for Skrulls, sympathize with Skrulls, view Skrulls as some messed-up X-Men-like social-issues allegory.

That was always a mistake. Skrulls should just have always been treated as a threat. That would have set up Secret Invasion for success. Not *guaranteed* success, but it would have been in a much better position."

Absolutely incredible!

However,
It seems that the most popular posts here on Reddit say it's the biggest garbage that the MCU had ever generated.

To each and their own opinions, but now, especially after all the other hate the MCU, and, by extension, several other media franchies out there goet on Reddit even though I really really like them,
Especially after all of the human psychology that I learned,
I have come to the conclusion that there's a high high probability that Redditors specifically and internet users in general either post more hate for something than love, because hating something drives and motivates you more into sharing about it with others than love, and also, hate is a very good way to attract people to your posts for popularity rather than love,
Or they see these other people hating on a thing and they just don't wanna fall behind this supposed popular trend that seems popular and common because of all the reasons mentioned above.

So yeah,
Thank you Reddit for finally making my heart realize the lesson of not having to feel bad if my opinion seemingly isn't fit with what the rest of the internet says and to not base my entire way of deciding what to watch and what not to watch on what the internet says about it. Perhaps I should base just some of it but not all of it.
I say my heart because it's been extended even further than being a cognitive ideology to go by, because my emotions have been corrupted by it for so long, which actually makes sense because the internet is a good source of social pressure and, as social creatures, humans have developed and evolved so that our emotions are heavily based on social interactions and norms.

And I'm not just saying all of this for no reason,
I'm posting about all of this so that perhaps at least some of the readers of this post might relate to it too and it might fit their internet lives too. Basically, I'm saying that this post might help other like it helped me.

But besides all of that,
Yeah,
The latest episode was awesome as fuck and it has built up The Marvels to be even more exciting than it was for me before!
And I hope we see Emilia Clarke as G'iah again in future MCU projects, not only because of her brand new and incredible superpowers, but just because I am now officially putting her as one of the coolest and interesting characters of the entire MCU!
Well, perhaps that is a little extreme,
But what I'm trying to say is that I love her character now very much! 🥰 lol"

The way it’s being told you would think MCU and the DCEU are pulling the same numbers.

I really want to know where this rhetoric started from. Now any film that becomes popular is ending the MCU and showing what people really want to see…. which is also just a fallacy.

"New Daredevil Reliable Rumours Reveal Series' Structure, Villain and new status for Matt Murdock",KostisPat257,856,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/15952cn,1690282470.0,"The series will be released in 2 9-episode parts with a short gap in-between each part and a different overarching plot for each part (think of Agents of SHIELD Season 4's pods). Muse will be the main villain of the first part.

What's more, the show will do small 2-3 episode arcs like Andor with each arc focusing a relatively standalone plot with all plots coming together at the end.

Finally, Nikki M. James' Kirsten McDuffie will be one of Matt's new law partners at his new ""Matthew Murdock and Partners"" law firm. Nelson and Murdock (and Page) is no more. 

It's been reported in the past by reliable leakers that Elden Henson has shot some scenes as Foggy, but Foggy and Karen will be mostly absent from the series and there will be a plot reason to justify their absence.

The series will deal with Fisk running for NYC mayor, a plot point which will first be introduced in Echo, with his campaign focusing on crashing NYC's vigilantes such as Daredevil, The Punisher, Spider-Man and Kate Bishop/Hawkeye with the first 2 appearing in the series, trying to stop Fisk.

Additionally, there's a rumour that an event of Daredevil Season 1 will be directly mentioned in the series and another event of the Netflix Daredevil Series will be shown in a flashback in Echo, making the Netflix series unequivocally canon.

And finally, the events of the series are rumoured to lead directly into Spider-Man 4 where Spidey and Daredevil will team up to stop Kingpin and some super-powered goons he has hired in order to take down the city's vigilantes.

To which Rhodes replies that neither was he, but they ""work with what they've got.""

It just struck me as a disproportionate comparison, as Nebula was referring to the extensive cybernetic augmentations to which she was subjected by her abusive adoptive father, which she sustained as a child through to her adulthood; procedures which were involuntary and which let her scarred physically, psychologically, and emotionally.

With this in mind, it adds a radically different dimension to his comments when he says, ""But we work with what we've got, right?""

Thoughts on mcu power levels and overall movies,Every_Scientist_5620,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15adm83/thoughts_on_mcu_power_levels_and_overall_movies/,1690396015.0,"Lately I've been feeling that mcu is kinda setting itself for failure with it's latest entries.

I've always liked their movies, even when they (admittedly) got a little to much on the woken side of things.

That been said, the sheer number of superheroes with drastically different power levels have been, imo, diminishing the overall quality of the movies.

It's pretty hard to get on the edge of the seat when you know that most of the latest entry problems might be easily dealt with by a handful of other reachable superheros.

Not only that, but a lot of the already established superheros get greatly diminished by a ever growing group of progressively stronger characters (some of them borderlining fanfiction characters, with almost every power in the hands of just one person).

I realize that most of them (or all) probably have a comic book basis, and that a bigger cast also mean an expanding universe, bigger battles, more empowerment and space to approach different cultures and important topics(all extremally valid points).

But, as a casual spectator, I wonder if by trying to embrace everything, they're spreading theirselfs to thin and effectively trading off a lot of the core values of the movie, like building tension with real stakes, creating a genuine emocional bond with the characters and leaving satisfying arcs for their overall story.

This thoughs are really not meant to enrage anyone, and I imagine I could be wrong with a lot of it... So, sorry if I offended you and please leave your thoughts so I can better understand what I got wrong."

This makes me kind of suspicious because they may not have mentioned how she was killed because she may be alive. Also, it was rumored that there would be a heart breaking skrull reveal in SI. What if this is it?

If Soren is alive, one theory that I do have is that she might be impersonating Shirley Sagar who was a part of the skrull council. Shirley was featured in episode 2 and she was the women who decided to resign from the skrull council. Of course this theory is probably a huge stretch.

Hot Take: Secret Invasion makes me more excited for the future of the MCU,rednight8691,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15aqglj/hot_take_secret_invasion_makes_me_more_excited/,1690428050.0,"So I agree with a lot of people that are expressing disappointment at the show overall. I had some fun with the finale, but I think ultimately, for a show that I felt started *very* strong, it kinda just ended up falling flat. I never felt that the show was *bad*, I think it just went from amazing to just okay. Which is definitely not ideal, and that’s why the show definitely lands somewhere in the bottom half of my rankings. 

But for a few reasons, I actually think that the show set up the future of the MCU in a really cool way and after seeing the whole show, I’m more excited for the future. 

It definitely felt like some plot threads were left untouched in the finale (or brushed over). But I do think that The Marvels will pick up on those, or at least some of them. And if they can resolve those in The Marvels, I think it could retroactively make this show a little bit better. 

Also, having this be the focus for Carol’s character arc (everything that has to do with skrulls from Captain Marvel to Secret Invasion to The Marvels) I think will make her arc a lot stronger. I think if The Marvels allows Brie Larson to truly be herself in the performance (which it appears so from the trailers), then she’s gonna feel so much more natural and could potentially come out on top as a true leader, especially with the skrull plot line in the background. 

And finally, there’s Rhodey. Everyone’s all up in arms because he’s potentially been a skrull since the end of Civil War/the beginning of Infinity War. I actually think it’s genius, even if a few moments are cheapened. I think it adds a level of stakes knowing that someone you loved was a skrull. And thank God this wasn’t an Avengers movie because then you’d get like 4 or 5 Avengers that were revealed to be skrulls and then everyone would *really* be up in arms. But given that Rhodey hasn’t had his own project yet in the MCU, I think he was the perfect choice. It doesn’t matter who they chose, people would still be pissed.

Anyway, don’t wanna get sidetracked, but I think that Rhodey having been out of commission for that long sets up a *really cool* character arc for him that can be explored in Armor Wars. That will allow them to really dig deep into his character in that film and I’m really excited about that.

"I'm gonna say it, the first half of Phase 5 will be mediocre or just bad.",Big_TinyRequest,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15arb0i/im_gonna_say_it_the_first_half_of_phase_5_will_be/,1690430594.0,"I just know the first half of Phase 5 will be mediocre.

I say this because well the first half of Phase 5 were being written the time Marvel was still being on the Quantity over Quality phase.

The amount of quantity and projects being released in Phase 4 was just so much and the writers and the VFX team wasn't given the proper time to perfect it.

How Phase 5 is going, I have a feeling Phase 5 (The first half at least) is going to suffer the same fate as Phase 4.

Secret Invasion felt rushed and the story was bland, it was okay but the potential was wasted. 

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania was suppose to be a great start for Phase 5 but it didn't live up to the hype of being the first project of the Phase, contributes to the Multiverse Saga and how dangerous Kang is. 

The Marvels, Echo, Loki S2, Agatha: Coven of Chaos, Iron Heart, Captain America 4, we're written during the time Phase 4 was still releasing content meaning the writers were not given time and were rushed to finish it. 

Now that Marvel is doing Quality over Quantity the CGI is gonna be good but would the story be the same quality as the CGI? We do not know. 

Now projects like Born Again, Blade, The Thunderbolts, Fantastic Four, Avengers The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars and other untitled Phase 6 projects has the potential to be good because the writers are finally given the chance and time to finish it. But with the Strike going on we're gonna have to wait."

Let's be clear: Marvel became cool- a fad. It attracted a lot of non-comic book fans, and kept some and lost some. Secret Invasion wasn't that bad, was it underwhelming- yes but, let's be clear: it wasn't Inhumans. The ones who jumped into Marvel because of the movies and that's okay, after all thats why they're there. Marvel literally licensed out their IP and made movies to drive comic and toy sales back in the day (and today, with its in-house studio). Though, now that the layperson is dealing with a complex lore and character and story beats that pay off in subtle or complex ways. If they're not into it, that's okay but, you're not a ""fan"" that should have a large say in the Fandom. Instead, you're a conditional-fan that likes some bits but, not others. Perhaps, your bits concluded with Endgame but, IMHO ill cheer when the X-Men and New Avengers finally meet with all the other characters in Secret Wars and critique it later.  And if you don't, it's cool too but don't bring down the vibe.

Which MCU series to start watching first? - My MCU marathon.,Eunos-Roadster,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159pfi5/which_mcu_series_to_start_watching_first_my_mcu/,1690329100.0,"Over the past year or so I’ve watched / re watched nearly every marvel movie in order of release and just finished watching no way home after re watching all the Spider-Man movies. I had missed some movies over the years or just not appreciated them at the time of release and others I’ve rewatched countless times.

Doing this has made me want to continue on with my MCU marathon and once I’ve watched the remaining movies, to make a start on the tv shows. 

The only movies I haven’t seen so far are: 
- Black Widow
- Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
- Eternals
- Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
- Thor: Love and Thunder
- Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
- Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania
- Guardians of the Galaxy 3

Ill get around to watching these in the coming week or two. Some I’m not bothered about as I’ve heard bad reviews but I’m determined to keep it going! 

In terms of Marvel TV shows - I haven’t really seen any! 

Apart from: The Punisher - Which is one of my favourite shows of all time and in my opinion I’ve never seen a character be so well played by an actor in anything! Jon Bernthal is a real one. 

Daredevil: Another one of my favourite TV shows! Exceptional from start to finish! 

So my question is where do I start! Are there some shows you’d give a miss completely? 

Is it important to watch a specific show before you watch another one? 

What are your favourite / least favourite shows?

My current list for TV shows is: 

- Agent Carter 
- Agents of Shield 
- Wandavision 
- Loki 
- The Falcon and the Winter Soldier 
- Hawkeye 
- Secret Invasion 

The rest are put on the “maybe” list! 

Granted this kind of question has probably been asked a million times and could be deemed a pointless ask but when your investing so much time to a tv series / multiple series it’s nice to get others opinions. 

Thanks in advance! 

Edit: I’ve also just watched into the spider verse and can’t wait to see the new one! I’ve added the spectacular Spider-Man to my list of tv shows!

Update: Thanks so much to everyone for their replies! First post on the sub and it’s great to be part of a community of fellow MCU lovers! 

Somehow there was a number of tv shows and one shots that I didn’t even know existed! So I’ve decided to give them all or most of, a watch! 

My updated list is below (please let me know if I’ve missed anything)  

I’ve decided to watch them all in order of release date. 

- The Consultant one-shot.
- A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer one-shot.

The MCU should Quit the Sagas…,rabooca,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15abxho/the_mcu_should_quit_the_sagas/,1690392234.0,"I feel the MCU should quit doing sagas because it’s becoming clearer and clearer by each instalment that 98% of these characters and storylines are never going to be revisited so you just end up wasting everybody’s time.

Also finally Marvel has all the characters and brands back under one umbrella but yet for some reason Marvel still thinks it’s a good idea to have a overarching story. Well as you can see with phase 4-5 the MCU is just way too big to maintain a QUALITY single continuous storyline as (with help of the Disney plus shows) most projects just seem like they are going nowhere. Another reason why I feel they should stop the sagas is because after secret wars we’re likely switching over to the x-men and that would be aptly called the ‘Mutant Saga’ but what does that even mean bc the mutant mythology is a whole other can of worms that could easily exist by themselves by I digress.

To conclude,I highly recommend and I’ve been feeling this way for a while that MCU should focus on CORNERS of the Marvel Universe like the Cosmic,Mystic,Supernatural,
Fantastic Four,Street Level,Avengers,X-men and so on and so forth and then every once in a while a majority could come all together to fight a common enemy 

Anyways,that’s just how I feel would love to know you’re opinions!"

I know that we now have this sloppily dovetailed thematic idea of 'endless possibilities' in the form of the skrulls, multiverses, and branched timelines, but I have zero clue as to what the narrative arcs are and whose story I'm invested in.

Now, not all of this is Marvel's fault since we can't deny that COVID, Chadwick Boseman, and Jonathan Majors real-world events certainly have an effect on what directions the story has taken, not to mention the fact that actors who came aboard in the later half of the Infinity Saga are at this awkward stage where their characters have gone through deep emotional arcs, but they're at weird points in this overall story, and those actors aren't necessarily looking to keep doing Marvel stuff forever. But the way this story is being told, not to mention Disney's treatment of writers and animators has given me enough reason to say that they can't really chalk up sub-par stories to extenuating circumstances anymore.

At the beginning of Phase 4, I was really intrigued by the potential setup of Wanda and Loki as main characters for this next phase. I loved the idea of using this theme of endless possibility and allowing two misfit characters from the previous saga have their time to shine and lead the narrative here. 

Even though Season 2 of Loki is on the way, the way the the story is being told so far just seems so out of balance. Consequences aren't felt throughout the shared universe, but individual stories don't even feel that compelling enough to justify being in their self-contained lanes.

It’s always been popular to hate whatever is popular, but the past few years have seen this to a completely unfair degree. *Secret Invasion* would have been praised had it been released even just ten years ago, but now it’s apparently garbage because you all expect it to be as good, if not better, than *Avengers: Endgame*. You have forgotten how to just relax and fucking *enjoy* something. But no, it has to be *perfect* now. I swear, you people genuinely enjoy hating Marvel, like you smell blood in the water.

(FF4 Introduction) The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to an emergency beacon of a spaceship that has reappeared after being lost for decades.

I feel that Marvel has painted itself into a corner with the Fantastic Four’s introduction. There are really only a few ways of introducing them. One is that the team will be from another universe. Two, they have been lost in the Quantum Realm, and three,  they are lost in time. I know there are probably other options, but these seem like the most feasible.

I would prefer an introduction that avoids the Eternals problem where the team has been in hiding the whole team and did not help in world-threatening events. Also, the Multiverse, being the answer to this, feels cheap. Time travel is tricky, so here is a fun option.

*The Guardians of the Galaxy respond to an emergency beacon that suddenly appears on their scopes. On investigation, they find a decades-old spaceship from Earth containing the cryo-sleeping bodies of Four scientists who were long believed to be lost and dead. Once awakened, the crew explains that during their mission, a catastrophic event happened, dosing them in radiation, and they went into cryo-sleep to save themselves, hoping that when they were found, they could be saved. But instead of killing them, the radiation changed them.*

*The scientists come back to earth and discover that they have been gone for a while, and their newly formed powers could help a world made vulnerable by the loss of the core Avengers.*"

Sure, losing him might be problematic for recreating the serum, but they already had his blood.

Disregarding the outcome for recruitment (which they might have anticipated, but not known prior to the Senator stepping in), it seems that his newfound abilities would be useful, if in a very directed approach, rather than a footsoldier.

Edit: for clarification, I’m not asking about any making other super soldiers. That’s been addressed so many times in the shows and movies. I’m asking about why no one above Phillips thought a single super human soldier could have been useful in the war effort on the ground rather than as a PR stunt."

From humble beginnings of Iron Man to the spectacular epic that was Avengers: Endgame, we let him lead us and he gave us a payoff that made sense and was rewarding to those who stayed the course. 

Of course I know the behind the scenes mess that preceeded all this complete and utter trash of films and Disney plus shows that followed afterwards, but blame still has to reside squarely on the shoulders of the man in charge. Ever since Feige was appointed to CCO of Marvel Enterprises, there has been a sharp down turn in quality seen on the MCU side of things. There was zero focus on where the story was going, no singular vision, no coherent map for where the journey will take us. It felt like every new movie or show was being pulled out of their collective anuses, and I will be the first to admit culpability to eating their crap with a smile on my face. Why? Because I hoped I was going to be rewarded in the end. 

Now, we have show after show, movie after movie that promises big but delivers microscopically. And that has to be the responsibility of the man himself. MR. KEVIN FEIGE, PGA.

He's touted his PGA mark with pride seeing as he was the architect of the Infinity Saga; why not show to the world that he was indeed responsible for everything? So he did. With that Producers Guild mark. But now, it seems as though every single Kevin Feige PGA production has become more and more convoluted and disconnected from the show/movie that comes next.

I was so stoked because I had heard great things. No spoilers, but just rave reviews about the movie. I finally watched it a few nights ago and haven't been so let down in a long time. I'll say, I put my phone down and focused on just the movie, so it's not like I missed anything. I watched it in its entirety. 

Let me start by saying Adam Warlock was a disappointment. I was excited for him to be in the franchise after GotG2, but this movie made him a puny side character.

The High Evolutionary was a temperamental scientist, not a big bad. After Ego, he just seems like a bargain bin villain.

That's another thing, no main character was ever in an real danger. Drax was fine after getting shot, the Abilisks ""only eat batteries""...with their sharp teeth.

I get what they were doing there for the story, but why did the writers feel the need to put those kids in the movie? I hate when a sense of urgency is needed so writers throw ""helpless kids"" into the situation. It's an overused trope in any movie. (Looking at you Love and Thunder)

There was way too much fluffy sap in the movie. The cutesy animals took me out of the narrative as much as the kids did. I had friends that cried at their deaths. Why? That's why they're there. Otherwise the HE would just be some arrogant scientist.

The music was even just okay. In the other two movies, the music hit right and drove the scene. In this one, the songs were just there.

Hell, even worse.

She barely had any character other than being an objecting joke throughout her appearance in the MCU and as only ""respected"" in NWH to make killing her off have impact. (hell, even Maria was respected more than May was in her appearances) And even then, they just cribbed Insomniac's May without getting why it worked.

Plus, all people wanted was them to just acknowledge Ben and his death, not for them to pull revisionist history and say it was always an ""origin trilogy"" despite them saying they wouldn't go over his origin again.                             

It's just asinely poor writing and I don't think many people realize how bad it is even with the recent chatter about how Secret Invasion failed in writing certain characters."

"Dear Marvel, Please Stop with these Disney+ Shows.",mitchob1012,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a74pe/dear_marvel_please_stop_with_these_disney_shows/,1690381143.0,"*This is a bit of a long one. Sorry 😶
There is a TL:DR at the end if you want to see my main points*

We're now 9(?) shows in and for *every single one* of these shows now, after dedicating 4-6 plus hours of my life keeping up with them, I'm left feeling apathetic at best, and bitterly disappointed at worst. 

I would love to sit in the writing rooms for these shows, because I don't know what goes on in there but it's starting to feel like Feige or someone at the top is mandating a certain formula for these shows that just is not working. 



Let me explain, the average Marvel Disney+ Show;

Episodes 1-2: Good-great set up that plants a lot of seeds that have some excellent potential. There's some interesting thematic work at play, but it really depends on whether the show nails the landing or not. 

Episode 3: Starting to lose a bit of momentum plot wise... The highs are *high*, but the lows are *low*. 

Episode 4: The one where they pull out all the stops or have their big shock ending. All roads lead to a certain point and it's priming us for an epic final few episodes! 

Episode 5: The show has gone completely off the rails and lost all of its momentum from the previous episode. It instead focuses on exposition and/or recapping the events so far. Because they've daudled around for so long this episode, I sure hope the finale is long enough to give all of these dangling threads the time they deserve! 

Episode 6: ""It was alright I guess"" 
Score is overall between a 4-7 out of 10. Despite launching right into the action of the episode they spend most of their time on a big CGI final battle that they don't have the budget for and leave all of the important character and thematic moments for the last 15 minutes of the episode. 
Of those 15 minutes, at least half of that time is spent setting up *future* movies and TV shows instead of actually resolving the conflict(s) at hand in a satisfying way. 
Were left with more questions than answers, and of the answers we have received, most are unsatisfactory or could have been done so much better. 




I've seen and felt these type of thoughts for most if not *all* of these shows. 

Getting real for a second, I know there are the strikes going on currently and that no work is really being done on any upcoming projects other than Post as it is anyways. 

But once this is all resolved (with a satisfying result for the Unions) I really hope Feige and Marvel and Disney really look at fan reception, or at the very least, the numbers. 

We know that Bob Iger is cleaning house at the moment (for better or worse) and cutting back on spending for projects. 
We know that Secret Invasion among (presumably) other projects have been getting significantly lower ratings than previous shows. 
We know that they can do better. 

I honestly think ever since we got these Disney+ shows, the MCU has been all the worse for them. 
They fell right into the criticism that so many people levelled at the franchise *before* Endgame in that there was already too many movies to keep track of. 

*NOW* there are too many movies and entire *seasons* of television to keep up with! 


Let's take The Marvel's for example; 
As of now there are at least 3 Disney+ shows that people should have familiarised themselves with in order to understand the movie (and that's not even counting movies).

We have, WandaVision (Monica). 
Ms. Marvel (duh) 
And now Secret Invasion. 

3 shows, all with mixed at best reception (minus maybe WandaVision depending on who you ask). 


*TL;DR*
Marvel has become a cultural landmark, but in doing so has alienated the general audiences that grew it so large in the first place, and is turning away even some of their biggest fans. 

I believe that Disney/Marvel *desperately* need to reconsider their current business and writing model for these smaller projects. 

Despite what they have stated, I honestly think they should focus on the Special Presentations as opposed to the shows. 

I have zero clue what the money situation with the two we got were and how successful they were for the company, but Werewolf by Night and the Guardians Holiday Special and by far the best original Disney+ content by a landslide, and it's no coincidence that they're both easily digestible, 45-1hr long specials. 

I honestly think if we had a Ms. Marvel Special Presentation to lead into the upcoming movie (same with maybe She Hulk and Moon Knight?) fans like myself won't feel so burnt out on the MCU. 

Give us a quick and easy slice of these characters that satisfy us now but also leave us wanting just that *bit* more. 

I don't want a 6 hour show about Agatha, or Echo, or Ironheart. 

But Special Presentations? Hell yes."

"The people who ""left"" the MCU after Endgame weren't even huge Marvel fans to begin with.",Inevitable_Golf_1816,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15a9mk6/the_people_who_left_the_mcu_after_endgame_werent/,1690387004.0,"This does not apply to everyone, but it does to A LOT of people.  

Imma be real, a LOT of people who left after Endgame were casual viewers who only arrived for the Infinity War/Endgame hype. I bet these people were ""fans"" for a very limited time.

I had friends, and those friends had friends who watched very little Marvel, but suddenly cared about everything that came before and were watching MCU films on their laptops when Thanos was around the corner. It was even a running joke between myself and someone I knew. My aunt does not watch Marvel, but saw Endgame because her friends wanted her to.

DS2 and NWH were anomalies because of their potential crossover elements. DS2 had Wanda, Professor X, Mr Fantastic, Peggy Carter, etc., while NWH had Dr Strange, as well the Raimi/Webb characters that were from outside THIS franchise. Black Panther 2 and Guardians 3 managed to be a massive success on their own merits, with no crossovers or fan service required.

I'm just sayin…..

Also, here’s my own hot take. The MCU doesn't HAVE to be the #1 franchise anymore. That doesn’t mean they should get worse. I want them to improve, but if they were to not end up at the top of the world anymore, then so be it. If I still have fun with it, then I’ll be OK. If this happens, that doesn’t mean it’s a dead franchise. "
What if doctor strange let thanos get the stone to prevent the earth from being destroyed in eternals.,RepulsiveGround2558,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159jgzx/what_if_doctor_strange_let_thanos_get_the_stone/,1690315773.0,"We know the theory how strange say multiple cases where they one but probably told Tony he only saw 1 because if he told him the actually number it wouldn't come to pass. But watching Dr strange 2 in the beginning I wondered if that was case they why did strange continue to say that was his only play so it got me thinking.

The man asked strange did half the population have to die not was it the only way thanos could have been defeated. And strange replies yes it was our plan. So I thought well why Dr strange could have used the stone on thanos or could have put him in a time loop why didn't he use a portal to go back to earth why did thanos have to kill half the population what would happen if he didn't.

Then I remembered in eternals they said how because thanos did that he prevented the celestial birth. And we know the mcu loves connecting movies so its not coincidence in the mcu timeline order this move comes right after eternals. Maybe strange new this would happen and new if the tiamut would have came 5 years earlier maybe the eternals would have let it be born causing the earth to be destroyed.

And yea that's just my theory sorry that this is long I like typing my thoughts out and also mb if this theory was already established but I didn't know I just thought of it myself rn."
Less characters/storylines and more connected universe/crossovers or more characters/storylines and less connected universe/crossovers?,Puedo60,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/159cw8d/less_charactersstorylines_and_more_connected/,1690301501.0,"So I hear that Bob Chapek pretty much forced Marvels hand to expand and over saturate their story telling in phases 4-6 

If we can get a redo. Would you prefer marvel to continue wrapping up any loose threads that were around at the end of phase 3 before introducing new ""solo"" movie/show characters? New characters can still be introduced but in other people's movies like DS2. (So more focus on legacy characters needing a sequel)

Or are you content with Marvel trying to expand the universe even though it means we wont see certain characters reoccurring as often or as much?

To me Phases 4-5 are like ""what if we treated these marvel movies/stories independently, without as many sequels planned right away, but they live in a shared universe. We're also not going to crossover as much because we want these characters to have their own storyline/movie"" 

I think the general audience would rather have less characters and less storylines happening at the same. That way it's easier to follow and ""would feel more connected"""

Netflix Marvel shows are notorious for working comic characters in the show, even if it’s just copying a name. So I’ve been wondering who Lewis Wilson is in the comics (he’s the veteran suffering from severe PTSD). It’s Force! Force, in the comics, is Clay Wilson. And what’s Lewis’s father’s name in the show? Clay. This isn’t the first time Marvel has replaced a comic character with a son. In Iron Man 2, Ivan Vanko is Whiplash, while it’s his father, Anton Vanko, who is the actual Whiplash in the comics. I just felt like sharing this revelation, it took me 2 times watching the series to figure it out, and I’ve seen many threads about how the character is totally new and separate from the comics. Why did they rewrite the character and make the son the villain instead of Clay? I’m not sure, but sneaking his father’s role into the show so subtlety was a cool move imo. The powers don’t match, we don’t see any similarities in costume, but it’s not a coincidence that we have a villain who has ties to a character with Force’s name. I think the goal was to create a new character with some kind of loose ties to an actual marvel villain. It’s little Easter eggs like this that I think make these shows so fun to watch and unpack. Let me know your thoughts!"

I actually fell off the Marvel train after missing this movie and hearing from everyone that it was terrible and have been behind on all the movies ever since. After watching this I'm now pumped to see the other ones I've missed.

Maybe going in to it knowing it would be extra silly made me like it more. I really got in to the goofy vibe it consistently put out. For just a fun action movie I watched when I was sick it was great. It doesn't take itself too seriously and I think that's fine. The one time I thought the humor was a bit much for me was the part with Sif but all of the other parts just seem to be consistent with the tone they were going for. Gor was also a great villian.

But what if Maria is still alive and he's talking to her? 

Fury has seemed one step behind Gravik this whole series which is very unFury. His whole deal is he's one step ahead of everyone. What if he faked Maria's death and she’s waiting in the wings to reveal herself which explains why he's back in everyone's good graces in The Marvels? Seems awful strange to go from being framed for murder to being back in space friendly as fuck with everyone. 

Now how did he fake her death I’m sure I don’t know. He’s Nick Fury. He’s faked his own death before he’s gotta he pretty good at it."
What Thor should have done in The Dark World:,Shadowkiva,9,https://i.redd.it/1c5kwbq5cydb1.jpg,1690221449.0,"Imo it would have been a MUCH better movie if Thor had killed Malekith (maybe even imprison him somehow but permadeath is fine too) then worked out a way to revitalise the Dark Elves so they can live in a new terraformed homeworld using the Aether. What he ended up doing was helping Malekith genocide his own people and while it's made clear that Malekith was a bad dude for being ok with that all-or-nothing approach it's also made somewhat clear that Odin was fine with it as well. 

Thor building off his climactic showdown with Loki in the first film should NOT be ok with that at all. Malekith wanted to rule the universe again in darkness... I'm sure out of all the other black hole grenaders at least some of them just wanted the darkness so they could chill privately and survive in peace. The surviving Svartafljàr could even later become either casualties or allies against Thanos out of cooperation with Odinson forming a new dynamic between the Aesir and the Svartalfjar survivors (especially after Ragnarok they understand each other more).

Cherry on top would be a Svartafljar rallying miniplot for Endgame Thor instead of the grimey Fortnite dobber who checked out of life and let his new alcoholic friend Valkyrie enable his own spiral into alcoholism. Come on... where's the God of Thunder from the comics? Where's the Thor that grows to be a better, wiser and kinder King than even Odin while still being fiercely capable as a warrior? Do that! Not every hero has to be supremely relatable in the most trivial ways. 

Anyways this is just my take and ultimately spilt milk."

All the shows and movies that have come out have all been set post-Endgame. For some of these - WandaVision, FATWS, etc - the timeline is important but movies like Shang-Chi, or shows like Moon Knight could have been set in that long 5 years. 
It just feels like that was a great window to have new heroes step up so that post-Endgame they'd already be experienced.

Thought of this during secret invasion because it would have also been really cool if Fury didn't get snapped away but instead had this taking up his time. That path could have allowed for the creation of the Secret Warriors."

As we look forward to 2024, Marvel Studios was planning on releasing 3 movies and 5 shows that year but with the WGA and SAG-AFTRA Strike, it will change.

In 2024, Marvel Studios was supposed to release their content including:

*Captain America: Brave New World*
*Thunderbolts*
*Ironheart*
*Agatha: Coven of Chaos*
*Deadpool 3*
*Daredevil: Born Again*

Which 3 movies and 1 show stopped production until the strike ends. *Brave New World* wrapped filming on June 30, 2023, but it still needs reshoots, *Deadpool 3* was halfway through the filming process, *Born Again* halted production and *Thunderbolts* filming date was delayed. Since those four ended their Productions due to the Ongoing WGA and SAG-AFTRA Strike, this will not end well.

Brave New World could end up releasing in 2025, Thunderbolts might release in November 2024, Deadpool 3 might be delayed to 2026 and Daredevil: Born Again could end up releasing in August 2024, meaning their 2024 slate will change. Ironheart and Agatha: Coven of Chaos are expected to come out this year, hopefully, if not they might get delayed to 2026 or 2027 respectively. X-Men '97 might come out still in 2024. 

I know, I know, how could I forget ""Spider-Man: Freshman Year"", the animated Spider-Man series coming to Disney+ that's releasing in 2024, well. I want this show to be canceled because we don't need it.

But 2024 could end up effecting Marvel Studios content that's releasing next year

- No big CGI monster battle
- Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh return (alongside Simu Liu obviously)
- Donnie Yen, Ke Huy Quan or Stephanie Hzu join the cast _(although Ke has already been cast in Loki season 2 … Donnie Yen would make a great Lei Kung The Thunderer)_
- A post credit scene where Spider-man seeks out Shang Chi for “karate lessons”
- A second post credit scene that teases what The Ten Fists are up to with the final text reading _”No really, The Ten Fists will return. Next time, baby”_"

If he shrinks by a small percentage shedding mass equivalent to one front adult-size tooth that will yield an explosive energy equivalent to one Hiroshima because that mass has to be coverted into something. Don't give me the ""his mass remains the same"" nonsense because it clearly doesn't when he's running around on top of guns and standing on people's shoulders without burrowing into their flesh from the needle-like pressure. He also punched that Leviathan in Endgame which if the mass was the same would have bounced him back several kilometers like a giant parade balloon, while the Leviathan felts nothing but a gentle tap.


Secondly is that (oh man this will make me sad again) Murphy's portrayal made me wish that T'Challa was still in the MCU as this portrayal of a charismatic, loner to the point of seeming somewhat arrogant (but really just good at leadership and making plans and strategies to get things done), science genius who studied from the best professors in the world is EXACTLY the T'Challa from the comics. Moreso with how, in the aftermath of his actions to prevent the ""bad guys"" with their ""bad ideologies"" from taking over the world and everything he holds dear, he still wrestles with the moral and ethical implications of what his scientific mind and his ability to mobilize people has wrought onto the world that didn't have that power or technology yet to even stand a chance.  &gt;! I also really liked how Oppenheimer had to balance keeping everyone working in the desert smoothly and making sure they all stayed where they were and kept everything a secret ... that could work with the Wakanda-isolationism. Oppie was even slyly stabbed in the back by a man he trusted who ended up being a mole for the USSR adding a geopolitical element to the personal stakes again.. fitting for Black Panther !&lt;

 He (in the comics) invented a new branch of physics around the unique properties of vibranium and quantum states, he was the first to witness an Incursion starting to happen by peering into its threshold and raising the alarm to the Illuminati, sent a mission to explore a distant planet then got displaced forward in time and still made his way back to present time, beat back the Skrull Secret Invasion along with a planet-consuming horde of symbiotes.

Why would the Skrulls want to take on a world that they can never win? Even if they nuked the whole world, the Hulk alone would destroy anything they built from the ashes. 

And on a side not, every single advanced civilization in the MCU should be looking at Earth as the scariest planet in existence. As far as they know, everywhere a human goes empire’s fall. The Kree sent an armada to Earth and only one ship returned. Thanos destroyed world after world, until he went to Earth. Not once, but three times his armies were destroyed, although the second time he did manage to escape, but on the third he finally fell. One green human goes to Asgard, next thing they hear Asgard exploded and the survivors are kept in a zoo on Earth. Celestials, can’t stop them right? Wrong! Two celestials dead.

What would have happened if MCU was real life? The remaining Avengers and Fury/Talos would completely vouch for Spiderman and the public opinion would instantly be in Spiderman's favor. Daily bugle works in a world where Avengers don't exist and aren't public heros.

We see the same thing in Secret Invasion. It js revealed on TV that shapeshifting aliens are in Russia. And shortly after it is shown that Fury is killing Maria Hill. Anybody with half a brain would know its an imposter rather than the guy who formed the Avengers and saved the world many times. Fury could also easily expose that Rhodey is a skrull. 


These situations to build tension need a lot of suspension of disbelief.

Also, I read a bunch of comments and a lot of people are talking about the vocal minority of conspiracy theorists.

It is not about space between projects. They dont have that stuff going out. TV shows used to put out weekly episodes throught out the year and people enjoy that and dont feel its too much.

The reason, is not the amount of projects, but the amount of parallel storylines. 

If the project were connected enough and leading to common points more quickly, there will not be any ""burn out feeling"". But now MCU is kind of generating a lot of mental load without payoff to fans. Except Wandavision and Loki, shows opened a lot of storylines and are still waiting to be continued. If we take phase 4 movies and series, it generated so much stuff, out the top of my head from Blackwidows running on the loose everywhere, to a Celestial threatning to destroy earth, with the power broker in place, many organisations including the ten rings, spidermans identity forgotten, multiverse shenanigans, bunch of new hulks...

And each project, does not resolve what is already outthere and does not build on it. Each new project, just adds new unrelated stuff. People were used to having some links, some caracters, or some stories come back every 2 to 3 projects. Not have more than 10 projects all just adding new stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not about the rythm of the project, but how they are designed. If the amount of tv shows and movies was the same, with the exact same schedule we got, but with more common stories, the feelings would have been much better.

As someone who's seen every project so far, no other show is essential viewing to ANY of the movies. A short recap can get you anything you need if some characters are crossing over (like Ms. Marvel to the Marvels)

Portions of this fan base has become very insufferable over the last couple years.

More on that in minute. I think the interactions between Rhodey and Fury, Fury and Talos, Talos and Gravik, and Fury and Sonya Falsworth, and whoever Falsworth is threatening this week with her charm and a weapon, have been great some of the MCU’s best. I think Falsworth has been a tremendous addition to the MCU. Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Olivia Coleman, and Don Cheadle have been a joy to watch. Some great acting here and I feel the writing has been solid enough. 

Therefore, I can’t help but be surprised and not surprised that others have been so critical. I’m suprised that more haven’t liked the show but not surprised because in the sense of the last couple years, MCU fans have become increasingly hard to please.


I feel that if Secret Invasion was launched in phase 3 or between infinity war and endgame, people would be praising the show’s darker storyline and talking about how great the show is. Instead people are nitpicking this and that and it just seems MCU fans are hard to please anymore, and it makes really hard to want engage with other MCU fans nowadays. Infinity War and Endgame created this insane and unrealistic standard, and the MCU was never going to be able to hit that level of standard every time post- Endgame, and when it doesn’t hit people’s unrealistic standard, then the movie or show is torn apart and criticized and to me that is just toxic. The MCU never even hit that standard pre- Infinity War. It was just popular (and despite some claims to the contrary, it still is… box office results are on par with phase 3 results). Just my two cents after observing for the last few years. 

TL/DR: If Secret Invasion released before Endgame, people would be praising the show. Now people have unrealistic standards and they’re criticizing the show because it can’t hit those standards, and to me that is insufferable and portions of the community have become very insufferable over the last few years. 

And yes, I’m prepared for the downvotes."

Thor’s off-world, Carol’s off-world, the Guardians are off-world. Hawkeye is retired but even if those three get involved, what can they do that’s so much better than what Fury’s already doing? Who else is there? Antman? The Wasp? What would they offer to this particular conflict?

At best, Carol gets involved but this conflict is just as much political as it is militaristic. Carol is a blunt instrument all around. She kills Gravik but there are a million other Skrulls already on Earth, so what solution could the “Avengers” really offer here?"

Have secret wars, have it be the big cameo compilation they want it to be. The reset, relaunch, recast a few years later. 

Lots of opportunity there, yeah we’ll have to cut our losses on some uncompleted arcs, guess we’ll never know what the eternals would be up to next. 

But the general audience would’ve seen or know of a lot of origins by this stage, if they wanted to be bold they could throw us into an already semi established universe pretty easily. Good opportunity to fix the mistakes they’ve made as well like dr strange. 

You can skip the big origin and open with say, a Dr strange becomes sorcerer supreme in a Triumph and Torment movie. There, dr strange in the status quo he’s mainly known and liked for in one movie whereas in the mcu it’s been 7 years and he’s still not there yet.

Or did Talos bring in 500k during the Blip and the other 500k after Fury fucked off to SABER?

On a related note, how did he do it? Even during the Blip, landing enough spaceships on Earth to relocate a million individuals would have to have raised *some* attention."

Hot take: the mcu should have a soft reboot,Lazerboy12342,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/158ach4/hot_take_the_mcu_should_have_a_soft_reboot/,1690204401.0,"So lots of people might be oppose to the idea but I think that the multiverse saga should end in a big even that wipes some of the mcu out while leaving some and adding more heroes and stories then they would wait a while at least 4 years to let people wonder what happened and then start a new phase. It would honestly help the mcu in many aspects like the examples below
*it could fully remove lots of the extra fluff or heroes that aren’t very important to the over all narrative 
*it could recast a lot of characters who’s actors unfortunately passed away without it feeling disrespectful or replacing the characters (black panther, thunderbolt Ross)
*it would take lots of characters who had Disney plus original shows and revamp their origins for a movie while keeping the actors to simplify them 
*would retire a lot of actors and actresses without having to kill them  
*reboot the hulk so that he gets the movies he deserves and finally have him fight thunderbolt 
*would bring in the mutants for their own saga (I feel it’s too late for them to introduce the men properly in one phase

Also many more. It would keep some all the heroes who still have good stories to tell like Spider-Man the guardians and Shang chi and who ever else
Feel free to tell me your opinion because I know not a lot of people would like this"

Imagine your not-so-religious neighbour being dusted, while you, a true believer, are left behind in the world of sinners. And that idea suggests a question whether there are other religious prophecies and beliefs that would be used as an explanation to the Blip.

I'm not sure how quickly did the facts about the Battle of Wakanda spread (I figure, rather instantly, but the facts don't always stop believers from believing), but in the early days there must have been some confusion, and various preachers could take it as 'the-end-is-here' scenario and mass suicides could take place."

Marvel Movies give their Audience Unrealistic Body and Beauty Expectations,Concerned_Movie_Fan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/157hq3p/marvel_movies_give_their_audience_unrealistic/,1690126144.0,"Hello everyone,

I'm an undergrad student in America, and like everyone else here I am a fan of Marvel movies. I'm posting in this sub today to talk about a dark side tour favorite movies (one of many to be honest). I'm talking about how Marvel, and others, show unrealistic depictions of male and female bodies, and how it can have adverse consequences for the young audience these films garner.

Its an unspoken fact in Hollywood that action film actors, especially male actors, use supplements and other ""enhancements"" to give them the superhero body they need to film. While I'm not trying to shame them, there is substantial evidence that young and longtime audience members try to emulate their film idols, and in doing so will oftentimes either start to hate their own bodies or resort to supplements like steroids to achieve their unrealistic asperations. If more actors and film studios were open and honest with this fact I think the audience would have more realistic expectations on what level of fitness they can achieve if they try. There is also the fact that the female actors in Marvel films are pretty much all supermodels, with perfect hair and make up all while fighting to save the world. Once again, not trying to shame but this can also give younger audience members unrealistic beauty standards. I think Marvel has come a long way in trying to not objectify it's female actors, and I think they do a good job overall, but this is still a glaring issue. "

I mean, imagine the days before Heimdall? If you, an Asgardian left on a mission, you would either have to pre-arrange a time and place to return (and the guardian would have to just hope that you would be there and not an invading army) or be important enough to carry a device like Stormbreaker capable of summoning it yourself.  

That, or (I suppose), Huginn and Muninn would have to be observing any Asgardians on missions, or a talented sorcerer would have to send an illusion to check up on you regularly. 

Idk, it all just sounds like a real pain to me. Asgard must have celebrated like mad when Heimdall was hired."
Thoughts on She-Hulk finale?,hushpolocaps69,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/157ej5i/thoughts_on_shehulk_finale/,1690117906.0,"Am I the only one who thinks the 4th wall break in She-Hulk’s final episode was overkill?

I would like to say a few things before I continue. For one, yes I am aware that the finale is nothing different from the comics as she would rip pages and skip through panels. Second, I am only talking about the finale here, any 4th wall break previously was clever and subtle which was great. Now let’s begin.





The She-Hulk finale just really over saturates the whole 4th wall breaking concept. 4th wall breaking is always meant to be subtle and clever since it’s a jab at viewers, the network, cliches, etc… Deadpool movies are a perfect example of how you do 4th wall breaking, you have Wade make a few quips, maybe a joke like him turning the camera or putting gum on it by accident, that is literally it. The DP films never made it to where 4th wall breaking is incorporated into the plot. 




She-Hulk going into the studios and forcing Feige to change the plot felt extremely excessive. Maybe they could’ve had a different approach. Even then though, the ending to She-Hulk is essentially that she can now change anything to whatever she wants? No life lessons no character development? I mean the bad guy gets arrested and Matt comes back but it felt underwhelming like we weren’t awarded that. It would’ve been awesome to see Matt come back on his own since it would’ve showed that he does care, not because Feige made him come back.





This also just creates a huge plot inconvenience like with Harry Potter and the time turners cause now every fan is just gonna bring up “Why can’t She-Hulk just see Feige again and stop Kang from killing everyone” and blah blah blah. Now everyone is just gonna bring that up when something in regards to She-Hulk doesn’t make sense."

Expressing my love for the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy,ekopwolston,38,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/156adtp,1690001183.0,"I LOVE THE GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY TRILOGY! I know how shared of an opinion this is, but I just needed to say it! I haven’t been able to stop thinking about Vol. 3 since I saw it in theaters. It’ll just pop back into my mind, and along with it the other two volumes, which I love just as much, if not more (My favorite of the 3 changes on a daily basis.). From the characters (Who I’ve been in love with since the first trailer I saw for Vol. 1, and my favorite character being Peter Quill.), to the worlds, to the stories (Every Guardians movie’s story has been immaculate, not to mention the antagonists, Ego being a standout and my favorite Marvel movie villain.), and the humor (So, so many quotable lines, with my favorite being: “You’re making me beat up grass!”), these movies feel like they were made for me. For a little context, the first movie I remember seeing in theaters was GotG Vol. 1 (I can still remember the heartbreak I felt while watching Groot die.), and GotG Vol. 3 was the first movie to ever make me cry (The tears were welled up in my eyes throughout the entire movie, it got especially hard to contain them when Rocket screamed, but I just couldn’t keep ‘em in after Rocket started playing “Come And Get Your Love”.), so I definitely have a bit of a bias, but putting every one of my biases aside I still feel like this trilogy is perfect. So many scenes in these films give me chills every time I watch them, with some standouts being the Guardians sharing the power stone, come a little bit closer, Ego telling Peter what he did to his mother, and the hallway scene. And the last thing I’d like to mention here is just how beautiful of an ending the Guardians got in Vol. 3. None of the Guardians family died, and their bonds with each other only got stronger. In a way, Vol. 3 was the end of an era for me personally. I’ve grown up with these characters, and it’s hard to see them go, but I’m not going to cry because it’s over, I’m going to smile because it happened. These movies will be movies that I continue to revisit for the rest of my life, and I’ll enjoy every second of them.

TL;DR - The GotG movies are my favorite movies of all time, and I just wanted to express my love for them! What do you think of the GotG movies?"

Here, I would like to present another theory, one that a few other fans have suggested before.

Towards the end of the first season of Loki, we were introduced to the [Void,](https://thedirect.s3.amazonaws.com/media/photos/loki-avengers-tower-scene.jpg) a pocket realm situated at the end of time. It is home to various timelines/universes (like the abandoned cities and the Stark Tower) and variants (like Alligator Loki, Old Loki, etc) that were pruned by the TVA. When they are sent to the Void, Alioth consumes them. Basically, think of the Void as a dump for pruned realities and Alioth as a living furnace that cleans it out to make way for more garbage.

With all this information in mind, I think there’s a good chance the Void will serve as the MCU's version of Battleworld. Being how Ailoth was seemingly killed or incapacitated by Loki and Sylvie, any universe that the TVA prunes in the future will remain in the Void. Overtime, these universes may accumulate and form a colorful patchwork realm like Battleworld. If there is no Alioth to consume any variants, the Void may also fill up with various civilizations that are similar to Zsaji’s people from the original 1985 Secret Wars storyline.

If this happens, I think Kang will end up using the Void as the location for his own secret war. At the end of The Kang Dynasty, he will use the TVA’s pruning technology to stop incursions caused by his variants and send any remaining universes to the Void. There, he will force hundreds of Multiversal heroes and villains to fight to decide who will get to live in his version of the Sacred Timeline."

X-Men rumor from August 2022,HandBanana666,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155wj92/xmen_rumor_from_august_2022/,1689965314.0,"There was recently another 4Chan plot ""leak"" about the upcoming *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* movie. This latest on claims that the original X-Men cast will be in the MCU by the end of the movie. Now I don't believe the overall ""plot leak"" because production hasn't finished yet, the source is from 4Chan, and there's little-to-no mention of the confirmed characters/actors (such as Emma Corrin who is suppose to be the main villain).

However, that ""leak"" did reminded me of a report from last year. On ***August 24th 2022***, the YouTuber Warren Thompson (aka *The Cosmic Wonder*) said that he heard a rumor about *Deadpool 3*. That some of the original X-Men were going to be in it and were coming to the MCU with Deadpool, and that some of them weren't going to be recast. He said it in this video at 3:00:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN\_vngrxjR0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN_vngrxjR0)

Then a month later on ***September 27th 2022***, Hugh Jackman announced that he was going to return as Wolverine for Deadpool 3 (or *Deadpool &amp; Wolverine* as it might possibly be titled). Then Patrick Stewart suggested that he and Ian McKellen are returning to their X-Men roles. So the rumor is probably true since original X-Men members were later confirmed to be returning.

But is that just coincidence? I think not! On top of that, Hugh Jackman himself stated that he made the decision to return at ***the end of August 2022***, which is the same exact time Warren Thompson reported on the rumor. So it is very unlikely to be coincidence. Sources:

&gt;He really meant it when he said he was retiring as Wolverine. But then in 2016, “I went to a screening of ‘Deadpool.’ I was 20 minutes in, and I was like, ‘Ah, damn it!’ All I kept seeing in my head was ‘48 Hours’ with Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy. So it’s been brewing for a long time. It just took me longer to get here.”  
&gt;  
&gt;**At the end of August**, during a road trip to the beach with his family, he finally made the decision. He called Reynolds, who’d been pleading “on the daily” for a Wolverine-Deadpool movie. “I think, actually, he’d given up,” Jackman says. “I think it was a big shock to him. There was a massive pause, and then he said, ‘I can’t believe the timing of this.’”

***August 14th 2022***, to be exact. A week before the video was posted.

&gt;“None of us wanted to screw with that,” Jackman said about messing with “Logan,” its events, or its somber, definitive conclusion. “I was really proud of that movie and what we did, and it felt like perfect. And actually, for five years, honestly, in my heart, I was done. **I was like, ‘This is it.’ And then it was August, August 14 \[2022\], I was driving and \[boom,\] it came to me like that.** I thought, ‘This could be so much fun; I’ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I’ve ever done.”  
&gt;  
&gt;And Jackman emphasized how much of a change of heart it was for him. “And on August 13, I was like, ‘I’m never playing that part again,’ I promise you,” he said.

Warren Thompson has also reported on some legit rumors in the past. Like Professor X appearing in *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* back in early 2020. He said this weeks before Patrick Stewart revealed that he had conversations with Kevin Feige about returning as Professor X.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTtq0WO9Z8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKTtq0WO9Z8)

Kevin Feige himself has also said that they don't want to recast certain Spider-Man roles like Doc Ock and Norman Osborn because the original actors were too good in those roles. That's probably also the reason why they brought JK Simmons back as J. Johan Jameson instead of recasting the role. So it is possible that this also applies to certain X-Men roles.

Stop Asking Why Fury Doesn't Call The Avengers!,AncientAssociation9,708,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15533ga/stop_asking_why_fury_doesnt_call_the_avengers/,1689886776.0," At first this seems like a smart question on the surface. Looking at it objectively however, just what are The Avengers supposed to do? Carol, Hulk, Thor, Spiderman, Sam, and Hawkeye are guys you call when you need to punch someone in the face. In fact, the only avengers who actually could be helpful are Rhodey with his government connections and Buckey. As we know Rhodey is the enemy and Buckey would be a liability if he was **once again** seen on TV doing something wrong. Shuri is not an Avenger, and the international community does not seem to be on good terms with Wakanda. I doubt Fury has any contacts with them. **These heroes are not detectives, and this situation is more of a who done it scenario. When you have a mystery to solve you don't call Superman, you call Batman and Nick Fury is the Batman of this universe.**

In the story Fury has given the audience multiple good reasons for not calling the Avengers for help. He explained to Skrull Rhodey that he didn't want to call them because the last thing you would want is a skrull taking their identity and doing something foul. A sentiment proven correct since Rhodey himself was a skrull.

The fact that Gravik wants the DNA of The Avengers is another damn good reason to keep them out of it. The Skrulls have proven that they can steal powers with Groot and Extremis. Last thing you need is them adding Carol and Hulk's powers from a stray strand of hair or blood. **Calling Dr.Strange or Wong might be the only legitimate criticism against Fury that I could understand because I don't know how much their magic abilities are tied into their DNA. After the crap that Wanda pulled, I would be hesitant to take that chance.**

People seemed pissed that Fury said he didn't want to ask for help because of personal reasons. I don't blame him. He wants to clean up his own mess and has just been betrayed by a group of people whom he asked for help in the past. He is a spy and spies don't trust people easy. **Also, Nick Fury, just like Batman, is a dick.**

Batman could call Superman to clean up Gotham, but he doesn't because he is a control freak, who doesn't trust anyone but himself to get the job done right. MCU Nick Fury and his comic counterpart are exactly the same. He formed the Avengers in the past, but he was in total control over those situations. He got each of them to do exactly what he wanted, even emotionally manipulating them with Coulson's death and keeping Carols existence in his back pocket. **He could have called Carol during The Battle of New York, but he didn't. Fury not using his ace right out the bag is on brand for his character.**

At the end of the day, you can like what you want. This show just may not be for you but complaining that Fury should ask the Avengers for help feels like something that sounds smart and obvious, but really isn't. It really feels like people just want another Avengers movie and are unfairly bashing this show when it comes to this one particular criticism."

I hope they find a way to nerf Capt. Marvel's powers in the Marvels.,JAAAMBOOO,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/156vd6o/i_hope_they_find_a_way_to_nerf_capt_marvels/,1690060123.0,"Captain Marvel is just way too overpowered and it causes weird leaps of logic for why she isn't just showing up to solve every problem. Depowering her (at least somewhat) will help future MCU projects answer why she can't just show up and solve the issue.

She is overpowered for the following reasons:

* At this point, she is \~60 years old in the MCU but does not appear to have aged since she has received her power. Will she ever age or is she destined to be immortal/invulnverable?
* She can literally carry a spaceship throughout space (without needing any sort of outside assistance to survive in the vacuum of space). In Endgame she carried the ship containing Iron Man &amp; Nebula from the middle of nowhere to earth and did not appear to be phased at all from doing it. From Infinity Wars, we know that Titan required at least 1 jump through a wormhole so is she carrying the ship through a wormhole or just powergripping it the whole way?
* She was able to just one punch Thanos's fleet and didn't even need to rest after doing it.

The overpowering is causing weird omissions/leaps-of-logic like:

* Why didn't the Avengers tell her of the plan to get the stones in Endgame, or if they did, why didn't they wait for her to get to earth? For the movie's sake, it would have really changed what happened during Thanos's initial attack. Also, how was she able to get to earth during the battle? Did she hear what happened and flew millions of miles within an hour?
* How hasn't she found a planet for the Skrulls to live on? We know that she can fly throughout the universe and is helping multitudes of other planets. Yet she somehow hasn't found one that the Skrulls can live on? Her finding a planet would obviously make Secret Invasion null and void. Also, why isn't Fury calling Capt. Marvel? I'm sure she would like to know that the original species she helped is trying to destroy earth.

Ultimately, Capt. Marvel has the same weaknesses as Superman. It's extremely hard to build tension in a movie/character when they can just easily physically destroy nearly any threat.

Also, I fully expect to see a Marvel version of Mr. Mxyztplk in the Marvels as a comedic foil and way to show ""well Capt. Marvel can't physically beat this being but can outsmart it"".

I think that it will have a big final battle with Sonya Falsworth, Fury, Varra, Giah and maybe a few of Gravik’s skrulls that have turned good all fighting Gravik and his ally skrulls. I think the harvest is going to play a pretty big role in this episode considering Gravik wants to use it on himself. I think it’s possible that Giah might use it. Which would make Giah one of the most over powered characters. And since this show seems to be killing everyone close to Fury, I think Varra might die during this battle. Gravik will definitely be killed by Giah. We will probably figure out what’s up with Rhodey and the real Rhodey might end up helping Fury. Possible setting up Armor Wars.  I don’t think Talos mentioned emperor Drogge for nothing, I think she might play a role in this episode or at least a post credit scene. There will definitely be a post credit scene setting up The Marvels. It will probably show Fury back on SABER and possibly with Monica paying off the WandaVision post credit scene and set her up to be in space."

Nanotech fetish - by Love and Thunder I was annoyed d by it, for once can we get something else like liquid metal or something or at get a break from it?

Setting up stuff with no payoff - the MCU NEEDS to go back to doing solo projects, I'm fine setting up a sequel and team up stuff but I swear to God if any of the upcoming projects (The Marvels, Thunderbolts, Captain America 4, Loki s2, ect)sets up anything I'm DONE with the MCU... There's even rumors that Blade (though that movies never happening) is supposed to set up Blade's daughter.

Ms Marvel - her being a dime store Green Lantern is still dumb but if she's a mutant why does she still need those bracelets? They don't even enhance her powers.

Listen to the fans - you'd be surprised how much better stuff fans have come up with (head cannons, rewriting their own version of a movie/show, ect). Because of the fans we got the actor from The Office ad Mister Fantastic (though his character died).

*Another MCU project that's never going to happen is Fantastic Four, Marvel should cancel both that and Blade and turn them into MCU cannon comics or videogames."

Now don't for a second think I'm trying to bad mouth Marvel just because I didn't watch Shang-chi. I feel like everyone who announces that they've ""stopped watching the MCU"" are the same kind of people to say vaping is better because it doesn't kill.

I don't think its fair to judge a franchises quality on how many people are watching/playing. So to those who watched every single MCU flick and followed up with every storyline. Is Marvel actually underperforming their work and putting less effort into it. Or are they still going strong and people have just grown a bit tired of Marvel?"

Why, with Fury's help, did they not improve their crafts and search themselves? The 1 million skrulls apparently had the ability to make it to Earth in the first place. Why have they sat around for the past 30 years not trying to help themselves at all? Once Carol Danvers had buggered off, what exactly was Fury supposed to do? How would he know of more suitable planets than they did? When Thor showed up, I guess he could have asked for some help there but, so could Talos himself. Or any of the other skrulls?

The suspense of not knowing who is real and who is a Skrull has been missing a little bit. I still like SI overall, but agree that the extreme paranoia that could have been present has been missing just a little.

I think that, with one episode left, the series will wrap up Gravik, but leave the question over the Skrulls still open for future movies to deal with a wrap up. I think that's where we may see more Super Skrulls, for the actual powered heroes to deal with. we may even see some of this in the Marvels movie that is coming up. In my opinion this would make be a great way to use SI as a springboard for the upcoming movies, and keep that paranoia going for a little bit.

Because the reason , is that the recent MCU movies (even DC ones) did not become box office hits that the studio envisioned, people are bored and moved on and now toys and video games movies adaptations are the next thing , so they will likely give the MCU a hiatus after Avengers: The Kang Dynasty which will be retooled as the finale instead or just  Secret wars and will revive it again few years later with a new MCU series starting with the fantastic four and the X-men  in a new Phase 1 to reboot the series (since fantastic four started the current marvel universe) with new actors and a new saga.

&amp;#x200B;

So, is it better that Disney will give the Marvel cinematic universe a hiatus after Avengers: The Kang Dynasty  or secret wars "

Has the MCU Unintentionally Made the Fantastic Four Redundant?,thedrifter129,111,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154v8sp/has_the_mcu_unintentionally_made_the_fantastic/,1689869401.0,"In the comics, the Fantastic Four is Marvel's First Family and often the cornerstone of the MU.  What the first Iron Man was to Marvel movies is what FF was to Marvel comics. Part of their success was bending the rules of the superhero genre; the FF were more explorers than superheroes, they had no secret identity, one of them was turned into a monster who hated himself and there was the family dynamic between team members.  The success of FF allowed Lee/Kirby to expand the Marvel universe even further and to also bring back older characters like the android Human Torch, Captain America and Namor.    

The FF was where Kree (including Ronan), the Skrulls, Inhumans, Galactus. Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer were introduced thus setting the stage for the Marvel Cosmic where characters like the Nova Corps, the Guardians of the Galaxy and Thanos would thrive.    The FF is also where Black Panther was introduced, Namor was revived and when Lee/Kirby wanted to test the waters for a Cap revival, they did a one shot where Johnny Storm met a Captain America impersonator (and yes it's wild they ended up being played by the same actor years later).       

The MCU grew differently than the MU, largely because Marvel Studios didn't have the rights to their characters.  In the MCU narrative, the Pym Family now occupies the role of superhero-scientist family.   Will the MCU shy away from the Negative Zone because  its too 'similar' to the Quantum Zone? The Skrulls and Kree have been given to Fury and Carol respectively. Time travelling has been given to Stark.   Will it be exciting to see Galactus and the Silver Surfer when you have already seen the Celestials in Eternals?  Are we going to have another Secret Invasion, story arc since Reed is usually the dude who works on exposing the Skrulls?   The Watchers have already been introduced separately in What If.    Namor, Spider-Man and Black Panther exist separately and it's up in there if we will ever get to see them interact with the FF.    To me it's going to be weird if the FF turns out to be the Junior Team of MCU 199999. This is a world where the FF wasn't around for Skrulls, Thanos, Civil War or Wakanda opening up to the world and where Spider-Man has already been in 6 movies already and the actor is ready to call it quits. The question; what is there left for the FF to explore? Can they actually be a force to be reckoned with in the MCU?  And how do you think the MCU will explain their absence?

The humour, underuse of Christain Bale, and a couple other things come to mind. 

However, after listening to the L&amp;T score, I came to realize that maybe the movie was meant to be bad. 

Now before I lose your attention, think about it. The entire movie really lacked any sort of 'meat'. But in one of the final scenes where the reach eternity and Thor gives up his pursuit on Gorr, and then we get a brief moment of seriousness from Thor. Whether or not you liked the movie as a whole, you have to admit this was a very important moment for Thor's development as a character. 

Now Thor is a father, and I feel like we may be moving into a new era for Thor, with all the goofiness left behind in Thor L&amp;T. Will Thor movies still have humour? Yes. But that doesn't mean the tone of the movies can't shift as Thor develops as a character.

Sorry for my shitty writing skills and my bad explanations. It honestly sounded better in my head and was just a brief thought that came over me when the score turned from fun and energetic to soft and emotional. Also hope this hasn't already been pointed out by someone else on here."
Thor should've been with the Guardians in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,JoeTheOneFan,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155ujc7/thor_shouldve_been_with_the_guardians_in/,1689960713.0,"There I said it. Seriously, what was the point of Thor joining the Guardians in *Avengers: Endgame* when they do nothing about it. Anthony and Joe Russo should've talked to Taika Waititi and James Gunn about what to do with Thor and the Guardians since he joined them in Endgame. Besides Thor didn't even know that he left the Guardians in *Thor: Love and Thunder* and now, he has his daughter Love and his home Midgard. *Thor: Love and Thunder* was an unneeded project that's why it flopped. 

Look, I like Thor a lot in his films but imagine how much Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 would've been awesome if Thor joined. We were robbed with a fight between Will Poulter's Adam Warlock vs. Thor fight and It would've been so emotional if Thor tried to save Rocket. 

Also, *Thor: Ragnarok* should've concluded the Thor trilogy and Thor should've stayed with the Guardians after that. It's just stupid."

Theory: Daisy Johnson isn't back in Secret Invasion like everyone thinks/hopes she is - she's actually back in The Marvels.,no_not_luke,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155tt7r/theory_daisy_johnson_isnt_back_in_secret_invasion/,1689959081.0,"I'm fully aware that I'm a delusional *Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.* fan. I'm also aware that Feige called the series canon not [once](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=m5e39EbGc1w&amp;t=118s), but [twice](https://www.slashfilm.com/537489/agents-of-shield-age-of-ultron-plot-hole/) (covering at least the first two seasons there) and has never said anything to the contrary, so there's more than enough room for characters to return *should Marvel want to*. It's that last part that's questionable. Many of us thought Marvel might play their hand in *Secret Invasion*; as happy as that would have made me, I could never quite picture it coming to pass (and while the crowd favorite to return has been Daisy, I thought it much more likely to see someone like Coulson or Mack). At this point, I don't see any of those happening...but I don't see all hope as being lost for future MCU releases, namely the next big movie.

What helps is that there have been some leaks that hint at a possibility of mining some of what AoS brought to the MCU. My theory doesn't rely on them but *is* supported by them, so I'll be including them after the foundation of the theory and **only** behind spoiler walls. I'll also preface what they actually spoil (and how much of a ""spoiler"" they really are) like I did above, so you can pick and choose which to see. (Not treating anything in a trailer as a spoiler.) Anyway, let's get into the conjecture of it all.

*The Marvels* is positioned to be Marvel Studios' first all-female team-up movie, crossing Earth and space to throw superpowered side-effects like teleportation at the heroes.. We'll see Fury return, this time in charge at S.A.B.E.R. in Earth orbit. In one way or another, these folks will run afoul of the Kree, whom will probably be defeated by the power of the main trio's collective girlbossery. Here's where I think Daisy could fit in:

* *Marvels* will be a significantly space-based movie; whether AoS was still in 199999 by the last scene of S7 or had branched into a new timeline with S6 (when the Snap was a little conspicuously left out of the story), both endings have Daisy aboard a space-travel-equipped craft.
* A Fury-run government agency will be involved in *The Marvels*; Daisy became a core member of the last government force Fury ran.
* The Kree will feature as enemies in the movie; Daisy has come face-to-face with the Kree on multiple fields and for multiple reasons.
* The film is clearly going for a ""girlboss"" vibe; anyone who's seen AoS can tell you that Daisy is pretty much the epitome of whatever the definition of ""girlboss"" is lol.

I'm not here to say Daisy is the secret fourth headliner of the movie or anything, but if Fury wants anyone to be on his S.A.B.E.R. callsheet, it's going to be the girl with superpowers who's tangled with multiple alien threats and has proven herself able to be trusted. Daisy can at least brush shoulders with a main character in a S.A.B.E.R. hallway or be the one to brief them in such a scene. Or, if nothing else, give Monica a line about her coworker and friend Daisy Johnson.

(I'd also do anything to see FitzSimmons doing a little space tourism/research on S.A.B.E.R. with Arya in tow, but I don't want to ask too much of Marvel.)

Now for the leaks, so proceed with caution if you want to maintain maximum surprise.

Let's start with MyTimeToShineHello, a leaker with a respectable track record over the last couple years, who \[[possible spoiler for future MCU event](https://twitter.com/MyTimeToShineH/status/1547692836329377796?s=20)\] &gt;!straight-up announced Quake's return in no uncertain terms!&lt; (the deleted tweet to which MTTSH was responding was asking about Quake). There are multiple other hints, like this one \[[same as other warning](https://twitter.com/AlexFromCC/status/1662798616803565568?s=20)\] &gt;!alluding to any one (or more) of the agents from S.H.I.E.L.D.!&lt;. Could they be lying (for whatever reason, since they haven't before), have bad info, or could plans have changed? Absolutely. (I mean, these tweets could even still apply to *Secret Invasion*, but I've let that one hope go myself.) But we take what we can get, and both reports come from reputable places - or at least as reputable as they can get in that sphere.

Additionally, other reports - not from those accounts, but from decent leakers corroborated by someone I trust in the industry with an ear on the ground - have indicated \[vague *Marvels* spoilers\] &gt;!we may see other fan-favorite heroines that don't have immediately obvious ties to the core characters. I won't say who here just because those are 100% spoilers, but they're out there to be found on the web. So we already have multiple characters without strong ties to main characters appearing in the movie because they're fan-favorite female characters. Well, trust me when I tell you that Daisy is even more connected to Fury and the heroes of this movie than the ""confirmed"" appearing characters are themselves (especially if you buy the theory that Marvel would retcon Daisy's Inhuman origin for reasons similar to why they subverted Kamala's), and if they're going for fan-favorite characters, the hype for Daisy to appear in SI has proven that it doesn't get much more ""fan favorite"" than Quake - at least in the right circles.!&lt;

And that's the sum of why I think the chance of Daisy Johnson making her triumphant return to the MCU is most likely to take place in *The Marvels* of all Marvel's announced projects: it just makes the most sense. There's reasons upon reasons for her to be present, whereas there'd be some shoehorning needed for most other upcoming releases. If this comes to pass, then it's just a matter of whether the story of AoS remains intact, or if they retcon it to be a branch of 199999. Honestly, I'm fine with it being a branch anywhere after the first episode. Just don't let the founding event of the series, Coulson's resurrection, be undone in the MCU. That's my only ask of Marvel, after actually acknowledging the series itself. Curious to see how I, and any of you, will feel looking back on this in four months!"

Since it'll probably be a while until she is in another movie, I was thinking about who I would like to see play her. My first thought was Millie Bobby Brown because she's a great actress who's not in the MCU yet and she's young enough to play Love. What other actresses do you guys have in mind? I also decided to edit the marks onto a picture of Millie to see what it would look like. It was rushed so don't judge my editing skills lol.

This show has so far been dull, uninspired, directionless and just plain bad. It's as if the showrunners watched Tinker, Tailor (or another John LeCarre film) and thought prestige television meant having two people have a conversation in a room about something boring. That's not what those scenes are for! They're using conversation as a means of gathering information from each other and reveal something about the characters we don't know already. Here, they don't do anything.

There are entire scenes that go nowhere. At no point are you aware of what a character desires or how they're going to get it. In Andor, we get to see the banality of evil and how an insurgency is first formed. We see the conflict from all sides and how there are several ways of being opporessed. What this show should've done is help the viewer understand why Skrulls feel oppressed by a system that requires them to maintain human form in public. At no point does the audience feel sympathy for their plight. We're not told why Gravik suddenly decided to take a big swing and why are so many Skrulls in favor of it. What was the catalyst?

I really hope after this strike ends that Marvel employs better showrunners and gives them enough latitude to do their own thing in the future."

What if there were no more movies and the MCU turned into a long running tv show throughout half the year?,Unusual-Math-1505,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1562k0r/what_if_there_were_no_more_movies_and_the_mcu/,1689979044.0,"I think if they do this then they could cut down on costs so things aren’t as expensive.

Mainly though it would make the storytelling streamlined and people could keep up with it more easily.

There are too many characters now and some are just getting abandoned such as white vision who we haven’t seen in nearly 3 years. This one long running tv show could combine everything and make it more streamlined. And it would be easier to keep track of where everyone is and the general timeline of everything.

You can have long running arcs for each season that won’t be limited to the 6 episode/4 hour content. Everything would have more time to breathe.

Half the season could be devoted to standalone episodes and then the other half can be dedicated to the more ensemble projects. 

Overall I think this could be an upgraded version of the 2012 animated Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes mixed with a game of thrones type production.

Also we never really got to see the TV series like Agents of Shield and the Netflix Defenders crossover with each other as well as the Avengers, wider MCU and Spider-Man. 

I briefly spoke to Mike Colter (Luke Cage) at comic con and asked him if there were any plans to have Luke Cage join the Avengers. He said nothing as of yet and that he has about 3 years of his contract left so Marvel would need to contact him quickly if they were to include his character. It does create some uncertainties about seeing the rest of the Defenders coming back but I’m hoping that Marvel come to a deal and can bring back the other Netflix Defenders along with Daredevil. 

Or do you think the MCU should be rebooted but this time everybody comes back? (X-Men, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Spider-Man, Agents of Shield, Defenders, Avengers). Would be good to hear everyone’s feedback of the MCU and what we’d like to see in the MCU going forward."

I'm just curious as some people have been wondering how long Rhodey has been a skrull whether Fury would have been a part of welcoming Rhodey as part of the Avengers knowing he was a skrull.

Like in Iron Man 1, The Ten Rings have Stark Industries weapons but they had weapons that are UMPs, M4s  (or M27s), G36s, etc. The military demonstration had a bunch of SAWs on a table. But it's specifically said they are all Stark Industries weapons. Do any current to manufacturers exist or was it all Stark?"

How would you feel if Marvel Studios made an original show/movie?,ThickProof409,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1558hh2/how_would_you_feel_if_marvel_studios_made_an/,1689899754.0,"Marvel Studios has done some fairly original things in the MCU. They've added several OCs into the MCU such as Agent Coulson and Layla El-Faouly and What If? Season 2 is gonna feature an OC named Kahhori. When they haven't made OCs they've changed established characters so much that they might as well be OCs like Moon Knight, Arthur Harrow, and Taskmaster. They've also made some original stories. Secret Invasion is one of them. Aside from the name and the basic concept of a Skrull invasion, it's a completely original story with pretty much no resemblance to the original source material. The Marvel Zombies episode of What If? was also pretty much a completely original story with the only things they kept being the basic concept and T'Challa being used as zombie food. I'm wondering if anyone would be down for them to go all out and make a completely original movie or show? For example if they made up a brand new superhero and villain and made a movie or show about that, would you be cool with that? Honestly I would be into it. It would be interesting to see original content from the MCU and it would be a nice change of pace and a neat little experiment for Marvel Studios."
How would you change the mcu?,trackerjacker666,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/155cpyt/how_would_you_change_the_mcu/,1689911952.0," 

Basically the question how would you go about the movies/phases. Would it be different or similar? I did something similar with just the first four phases but here is my full timeline

Phase 1:

* Iron man- pretty much the same except maybe no identity reveal (if i could have a younger iron man thinking chris pine)
* Iron man-no whiplash maybe crimson dynamo instead
* Hulk -pretty much the same (kinda want to see how Jamie Dornan would play Bruce banner though)
* Captain America- pretty much the same except maybe get a little bit of an older cap like hitting 30 instead of early 20s like the movie tried to do to show the affect of being in war for years.
* Thor- with the thor movies they'd all be dramatically different in the sense I'd want to change the genre for every one. This would be a mystery/action with Donald Blake trying to figure out what his weird dreams about being a Norse god are about.
* Avengers- the main villain would be masters of evil (the villains are all former villains from the old movie teaming up). Iron man identity reveal at the end

Phase 2

* Iron man 3- this but with the real mandarin
* Captain America 2 serpent society: plot twist though the serpent society are actually skrulls and they've been controlling the government and framed captain America the end is with him going on the run. (Lol lizard ppl run the government)
* Thor 2- the genre here would be horror and feature a physical split at the end of avengers of Donald Blake and Thor except donald Blake goes crazy and got on a killing spree of everyone connected to thor making him feel powerless. (This is based off the Thor #11 comic from 2020 my personal new favorite comic)
* Yellow jacket- hank pym is yellow jacket cuz it's my favorite persona he had. But hank pym is basically a workaholic man who hates the idea of the avengers.
* Hulk 2- the cube has a massive breakout and the hulk has to stop it
* Hawkeye- introduces Hawkeye as the circus kid turned criminal who has to learn he has a bigger role to play. (Maybe some references to captain America 2)
* Black widow- black widow is an assassin who is trying to be taken down by government operative... Hawkeye
* Captain America 3- captain America proves his innocence by the end
* Fury- plays off the events of captain America where Nick fury has to fight the skrull secret invasion. He thinks he's done it but then he learns that the issue is much bigger than it seems... (Talks about a previous Skrull invasion years ago but he had captain marvel to help)
* Hulk 3- Ross who is basically pissed at banner creates red hulk serum and aims to kill the hulk.
* Black panther- a coup d'etat in wakanda leads an ending of tchalla seeking out the help of the avengers
* Thor 3- this will be primarily action with a little bit of drama. In Thor 1 the enchantress (the main villain of that movie) reveals to the loyal Loki that he's actually not Asgardian. Although out of love for Asgard and his brother he stays. Overtime though as he realizes Thor doesn't want to be king and his father refusing to give him the position because of his frost giant origins (even though the movie will play it clear as him being perfectly capable) he starts to turn against Asgard and it will be brother vs brother. I expect this to be much sadder as we had 2 movies of brother growth already. We also learn Loki as a means to distract Thor has been giving powerful and dangerous weapons to mortals such as Ulysses klawe (who helped overthrow wakanda).
* Avengers 2- following Thor 2 Loki attacks the earth. The 4 from the previous as well as the new 4 from the new movies team up to stop him. It ends with them defeating Loki and going to kick out the new dictators of wakanda.

Phase 3:

* Iron man: armor wars- basically the name
* Black panther 2- black panther 2 but with tchalla as the protagonist
* Black widow and Hawkeye- a sequel to both movies but now as a team up (I'm gonna start making dual movies/sequels so this would be considered both black widow 2 and Hawkeye 2) main villain will be local villain kingpin who has gotten a little too involved in foreign affairs for just a New York villain causing these two heroes to step in.
* Hulk 4- plays off of hulk 3 where banner learns Ross is red hulk causing an extreme feeling of betrayal considering he's his father in law. Hulk in this anger does a little too much destruction and introduce hulk buster.
* Thor: Ragnarok- thor 4 plays into the fall of Asgard and Thor accepting his responbilites as king. Revealed thor and jane break up. Mjolnir destroyed.
* Fury 2: secret invasion- playing off the events of the last movie fury realizes he can't defeat the skrulls but can expose them leading to the world finding out about the invasion.
* Quicksilver and the scarlet witch- introducing my favorite x men villains turned heroes
* Captain America and the winter soldier- cap finds out bucky is alive and tries to hunt him down.
* Yellow jacket and the wasp- this one will be like quantumania except obviously no Scott Lang or hope. Ends with hank realizing there needs to be better protections on the world he contacts Bruce banner and Tony stark to form ultron
* Avengers 3- ultron is a shit show. One year later we see ultron has taken over the world and the avengers (along with their 4 new members yellow jacket, wasp, and the maximoff siblings) make one last stand against him. leads to the death of coulson, old Peggy, maria hill, and Betty Ross causing a fraction and mistrust between the avengers for creating Ultron in the first place. They also discover at the ends ultron had something called the vision protocol. Something half want to look into the other half don't

Phase 4 (possibly my shortest phase)

* Hulk vs Thor (hulk and Thor 5)- after hulk went berserk in the last movie and is feeling getridden in his creation of Ultron banner barely wants to come out and the world has turned against him. Thor hates banner for helping create ulton as a lot of the final stand fighting happened in new Asgard so a lot of his people died as the hulk raged against Ultrons forces. Culminates In Steve Rogers asking hulk to start to operate independently and Tony stark asking thor to help take down hulk. Hulk is beat by Thor and is sent away in a spaceship with the space stone as it is too dangerous to be left on earth and needs to be hidden. This leads to the public hating both Thor and hulk. So Tony asks Thor to leave earth which he does.
* Spiderman- a few months after Ultrons defeat a junior year peter Parker becomes spiderman and faces the shocker. Dates Liz Allan but breaks up also introduces gwen stacy. Also meets Tony stark. In post credit scene harry osborne returns from an exchange program
* Captain America and the falcon (cap 5 and falcon 1)- captain America and the falcon team up to get bucky pardoned. leaving mistrust with the public and both heroes.
* Vision protocol- fury, black widow, Tony stark, black panther, and wasp want to operate the vision protocol. Tony thinks this is the way in order to makeup for what he did with Ultron. Meanwhile captain America, Hawkeye, hank, quicksilver, and scarlett witch want to not use it. Hank thinks the avengers should stop in these risky defense moves. Steve agrees. Vision is made anyways.
* Avengers civil war- after the creation of vision the government wants the avengers to be controlled by them. Team iron man makers agree saying it's only fair as they feel responsible for a lot of these terrible events. Team captain America although they also blame themselves they also note they didn't want vision to be created and think government control on heroes is bad. Years of mistrust is finally unleashed leading to a battle. Falcon and winter soldier join team caps avengers. Spiderman and vision join team starks. Ends with winter soldier dying, black widow betraying her team but turning herself in, hank refusing to fight his wife so he turns himself in, falcon wants to operate independently so he goes on the run, and captain America, Hawkeye, quicksilver, and scarlet witch becomes the secret avengers (avengers on the run as criminals but still do good deeds). Tchalla has to leave to become king of wakanda. Vision decides the superhero life isn't for him. Leaving the avengers as iron man, wasp, fury, and spiderman.

Phase 5

* Guardians of the galaxy- More like the second movie introducing star lord, gamora, rocket, groot, drax, mantis, adam warlock, and nebula. Although not part of the team introduces Jesse Alexander and Richard rider with richard rider sacrificing himself.
* Dr. Stange- just like the movie
* Planet Hulk- Like the animated film with a post credit scene of thor arriving at sakaar warning him of a threat coming for the space stone. Banner and hulk share control.
* Black Panther 3: Revolution- Reverend Achebe attempts to lead a coup in wakanda
* Iron Man 5: Demon in a bottle- Iron mans old foes come to face him after the civil war incident and tony clear starts to develop ptsd and a drinking problem
* Spiderman: Poison strike- Scorpion shows up in peter's senior year. Peter dates gwen. In post credit scene norman osborn shows up (it would be cool to see andrew garfield take the role).
* Wasp: Revelations- Wasp becomes her own hero as she takes on mandrill. 
* Fury And the last stand- Fury finally ends the skrull conflict on earth.
* Thor and the god butcher- Thor fights the god butcher- and realizes he shouldn't be king of Asgard and instead should be a galactic hero. Post credit scene would be Thor goes to xandar after hearing a distress call and it's revealed someone wiped out half the planet and took the power stone. Thor goes to sakarr to warn an old friend someone is coming for the space stone. 
* Captain marvel- pretty much the movie but good
* Avengers: infinity War- Thanos on xandar faces off against numerous nova's including Jesse where they fail to stop him from taking the power stone and heads to sakaar. after the fall of sakaar banner arrives on earth. And warns Dr strange and tony of an attack. Strange, iron man, wasp, spiderman, fury, and hulk end up in space (and titan). Thor meets the guardians and warns them and they split up. Thor gets stormbreaker and goes to wakanda to help panther, captain America, quicksilver, scarlet witch, vision, Hawkeye, and falcon. Quill and Adam warlock go to titan and the rest of the guardians head to New York to defend the reality stone. The guardians in new York plus black widow and yellow jacket fight but fail to stop the reality stone from being taken. Thanos takes gamora. Thanos kills gamora for soul stone. Thanos goes to titan and kills Adam warlock. He takes the time stone stone. Finally as a last stand in wakanda thanos kills quicksilver and vision and snaps erasing half of all life. The only ones left is Groot, rocket, yellow jacket, black widow, hulk, fury, wasp, iron man, captain America, black panther, Hawkeye, and Thor. 

Phase 6

* Rocket and groot- although doesn't reveal the direct events post snap this tells the story of rocket and Groot and how they met. Also shows them recovering after the snap.

* Hawkeye and the rise of ronin- Hawkeye is depressed post snap and becomes ronin. 
* World war Hulk- hulk doesn't know if his wife died in the snap or the initial killings that thanos did. Regardless he is stressed and when he finds out that his wife actually died in his ships explosion he blames the avengers and starts rampaging. When the avengers are too busy to stop him general Ross brings in the thunderbolts plus war machine where they all die except for rhodes. Eventually he starts to feel bad but he finds out Miek actually rigged the ship this caused hulk to kill his former warbound and almost annihilate the world until his wife is revealed to be alive. This calms hulk down and Thor, captain America, and iron man bring banner in. Hulks wife goes back to sakarr and dies giving birth.

The new X-Men from 2000-06  consisted of those just as cyclops and jean grey. Those like wolverine and professor x were on both teams. They disbanded once magneto was arrested.

Spiderman reveals his identity as the government ordered him too. There is a reveal hulk was sent to space because strange, a young college prodigy, an alien king, and iron man voted on it.

Wolverine is the only one with memories until he finds a mutant who also remembers and has the power to help others remember. Wolverine takes spiderman, Hawkeye, and quicksilver to take down Wanda. Magneto tries to stop them and Wanda shouts ""no more mutants"". This brings back the old timeline but Charles Xavier is missing and the mutants are no more.

They get iron man, black panther, hulk, spiderman, falcon, captain marvel, war machine, iron heart, Dr strange, and Monica Rambeau becomes the avengers.

They end up fighting against doom and strange until finally spiderman (who found a symbiote suit) confronts molecule man to undo this world and this leaves the fantastic four restoring each world.

Is sonya falsworth a comic character?,sayamemangdemikian,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154gpcf/is_sonya_falsworth_a_comic_character/,1689826898.0,"Played by olivia colman in secret invasion. Was she in the comic cos I cant find any. Or is she original creation for MCU?

Colman did amazing. Like basically teaching all these MCU actors on how to act. Sonya is like Amanda Waller if amanda waller super cool, british, witty, and super cool.

I still felt cheated cos what happened to Hill just too soon.. (sigh, cant she has more episodes?? Why was colbie always only given 2 mins of screentime on any show she was in??).. but man Sonya has been a highlight that i look forward to on every episode. 

It's cool if she was original creation. But even if she is new..  is she even based on anything in marvel comics?"

Why are these shows promoted as 6 hrs when they are not?,AVR350,972,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153nsxn/why_are_these_shows_promoted_as_6_hrs_when_they/,1689751198.0,"No Spoilers for Secret Invasion, just the runtime or the latest episode which is given in spoiler tag

As we all know, there is a lot of variations in episode runtimes in MCU shows...same issue with its most recent one, Secret Invasion...

Idk about other regions but in mine the episode runtimes are as follows

1-52 mins

2-55 mins

3-41 mins

4-35 mins

&gt;!5-36 mins!&lt;

In total thars 3.39 hrs...now the finale episode will most probably be max one hour..and we can say the total duration would be 4.40 hrs, or 4.30 hrs if it's in the 50 mins range, or even less...

And then there are 4-5 mins worth of recaps, credits , opening etc....minus all that and we will get a 4 - 4.15 hrs worth of content when these shows are themselves promoted as "" six hour movies""...which basically means they aren't 

This is also the case in all of the shows, which i think are a bit longer than this, making this one of the shortests or maybe the shortest one...
Whats your opinion on this?

Showcasing Monica's power looked so cool, Carol flying around, and the rainy looking environment between Monica and Carol looks nice and looks like we're gonna get some serious talk between this two in the Movie.

I just finished Infinity War for the first time and I am speechless,Hamza9236,2631,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153flk6/i_just_finished_infinity_war_for_the_first_time/,1689726884.0,"Probably should give some background here, I was never really much of a superhero guy, and I only just saw the first Spider-Verse movie a few months ago before watching ATSV, but I had seem some Marvel movies in the past, mostly the Black Panther ones and Guardians 2 since my dad was somewhat of a fan of them while I was in my Star Wars phase.

Then Guardians 3 came out and a bunch of people in a Discord server I was in was singing it's praises, saying out it was one of the last good Marvel movies, which had me intrigued. So what did I do? On May 13, I went to Disney+, and watched both the first and second Iron Man movies (Hulk wasn't on the service yet, so... ☠️). Suffice to say, I was more than interested after enjoying the first Iron Man plenty, and while the second didn't really deliver, it showed me there was some potential and a place for this franchise to go.

So over the course of the next two months I've been binging Marvel movies and even took the liberty of ranking of them, and slowly, but surely, getting invested in the numerous characters I was being slowly introduced too, and tagging along for the ride. 

Jump to July 18th of 2023, and I finished Infinity War in full for the first time. I won't lie here, this film nearly brought me to tears at the end and I can't think of much words to describe. While each of the other films preceding this have their fair share of problems, whether it'd be just one or numerous, with Infinity War, I have absurdly little to critique about it. My heartstrings were being tugged at during the final half hour like you wouldn't believe.

Now I know how all of the fans have been feeling waiting for this to come out since the release of Iron Man or whichever movie came out the year you were introduced to the MCU, and how everyone felt by the end of the movie after the massive buildup it had going for ten years.

This was a 10/10, undoubtedly the best MCU movie, and I don't think I'll stop singing my praises, and can't wait to see Endgame soon."

Personally my favorite of these scenes has to be our first tour of Talokan. The sense of scale while also showcasing its differences from Wakanda and other mythical/mystical places was astounding. The music and real emotion on peoples faces was absolutely beautiful, I actually teared up with the music (personally I love latin influenced music) and it helped me believe in Namor and his people.

First thing I noticed is Carol casually mentioning that she’s just sitting in space…not helping the Skrulls. 

Second, the villain of this movie looks like another “outer space villain coming to end the world”. I know she’s Kree and she has the other half of Kamala’s bangle, but what is she *really* doing here?

Monica Rambeau is gonna be the star of the movie just by seeing her leader attitude facing Carol Danvers because she’s grown up now, especially the tension between them hinted in WandaVision.

I just didn’t see how this connects to the bigger picture. Maybe that’s not what the trailers are for anymore, but are we seriously going from Secret Invasion to this movie? It’s very Disney+ and redundant to the Multiverse Saga.

Edit: The problem i’m noticing in Phase Five is these shows and movies Marvel is putting out is framed in a way where it’s like “watch this to see the how this character’s storyline ends” and not “watch this to see the culmination of the Multiverse Saga”. They’re still carrying that epilogue attitude we felt in Phase Four. It’s tiring and the message of the Multiverse Saga gets lost the more we see this type of content."

Conspiracy Theory: Secrets Invasion is the first MCU title written by AI.,kwontonamobae,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/154tn5a/conspiracy_theory_secrets_invasion_is_the_first/,1689865933.0,"So since I've started watching Secret Invasion, its been apparent that with each episode there's a drop in quality with the most recent feeling wildly disjointed. I think the biggest reason for that is Marvel Studios opted for AI to write the script for the show and had people kind of fill in the blanks where AI fell short. 

So now you must be thinking, hey that sounds a little crazy, why AI? Well consider the following: the writers strike and the intro. One of the core issues that sparked the strike was the propensity for AI having the ability to write shows and movies, which for obvious reasons is less than ideal. The intro for the show is said to be AI generated, which is a very unprecedented move. If showrunners were willing to forego artists in favor of AI to make the intro to save money, who's to say they wouldn't do the same for the script if the opportunity afforded it? The events of the strike and use of AI that we know of is weirdly coincidental. It could be that this show is what set off the strikes, or at least one of the reasons."

Quantumania ending was almost good,ftlofyt,789,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1534ad0/quantumania_ending_was_almost_good/,1689700341.0,"First let me start off by saying I wasnt a fan of the movie but I felt that the film almost achieved something good with its ending. The part I am referring to was when Hope and Scott were seemingly trapped in the Quantum verse. I think the film wouldve been much stronger emotionally if it ended with them being trapped together (mirroring how Hank and Janet were both trapped in their realities without each other)

Scott once again wouldn't be with his daughter but this time she would understand the sacrifice and it would further shape her character going forward for a young avengers film or whatever plans marvel has for her. I doubt Scott has much more story in the MCU to begin with and this would've been a bitter sweet way to tie up his character without killing him off.

Instead the movie did a half measure where Hope and Scott's sacrifice was immediately reversed and undone by them magically being rescued seconds after their new reality was setting in. 

I just feel like marvel movies haven't had a lot of guts to pack an emotional punch lately and this was the perfect example of that. 

If they stuck to that ending I think the film wouldve been much better recieved as it would've had consequences, instead it really had no effect on anything despite vague allusions to Kang not being defeated."

What's the Skrulls problem?,Swing-Full,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153wg33/whats_the_skrulls_problem/,1689776552.0,"Like so there were originally 20 of them, most of them worked for Shield as Secret Agents for decades. 

They impersonated people, and lived lives, had friends, family, fun, food. They were being paid well and potentially had generational jobs if they had kids as Spies.

Then over time more Skrulls came due to being hunted by the Kree and found safety on Earth. 

Now obviously those newer Skrulls - which is revealed to be a million - wouldn't have those jobs, but obviously take other people's lives. 

I don't understand the problem, just assimilate, they have no Homeworld, and Space tech isn't advanced enough to travel super far away, just a Space Station around Earth. Humans haven't developed the technology for Space travel, in Endgame they were using the Guardians ship, which the Guardians obviously left with. 

Is it really that bad for Skrulls on Earth to be green in public? 

I dunno, nuking the World makes little sense considering there are only a Million Skrulls and they'd have to rebuild infrastructure and then hunt down surviving Humans. 

Is it just me?

No Mutants until after Secret Wars?,BigDulles,674,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/152yy8w/no_mutants_until_after_secret_wars/,1689687995.0,"At this point, it seems that while they’re teasing mutants, the obvious setup is to wait until after Secret Wars destroys the multiverse to have an easy out to introduce Mutants into the proper MCU timeline. It would feel odd to bring in a lot of them in Phase Six only to end the saga there, when it would be very easy to use the whole “rebuilding the multiverse from scratch” thing to put Mutants in the main continuum.

The only thing that I think could challenge this is what happens in Deadpool 3, but I’d bet we’ll see most of the Fox X Men who come back bite it, or their universe will get incursioned, and Deadpool will be the only survivor.

What do you think though, is there any good way to involve mutants before that?

Edit: I guess I wasn’t clear enough, obviously some mutants already exist. I mean introducing large numbers of mutants with mutant-related plots. There are no X-Men as of now."

Why do some people want Wanda to be the one to add mutants to the mcu?,Nearby-Can9806,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/153ckeu/why_do_some_people_want_wanda_to_be_the_one_to/,1689719372.0,"I see this on every thread discussing how mutants get brought into the mcu. Someone suggests that wanda pull a reverse House of M “No, more mutants!” Or something and that’s how they come into the mcu. 

I just don’t personally understand the appeal of this, so if someone can help me understand I would appreciate it. 

Because firstly Wanda doesn’t have the power to do that, like how in the comics she needed to absorb a nexus force of creation with the help of dr doom to temporarily get that power which drove her mad and then you know what happens next.

 But following a plot similar to that in the mcu will just lead to her becoming a plot device which isn’t what her character needs. 

Next it was already not great having an avengers character in a largely avengers story bye bye the mutants. But in the mcu I don’t see any reason at all that doesn’t feel EXTREMELY forced for her to do this. 

She became an avenger instead of appealing to the X-men in the comics because mutant politics didn’t appeal to her. Why would you want her to then be the one to literally create mutants?"
Looking back on 2019's CAPTAIN MARVEL,JediNotePad,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/15440cp/looking_back_on_2019s_captain_marvel/,1689793953.0,"Before I even write anything, know that this post is not for the folks with zero braincells who talk about this movie being ""woke"" or how it brought in the ""M-She-U."" If you talk like this, rethink your life, touch some grass, and skip this post. Anyways, on with it. 

So I re-watched CAPTAIN MARVEL recently and like most, the movie was fairly forgettable. I do like Larson in the role, and the cast itself delivered solid performances, but man, aside from maybe the score, there was not one thing that I found to be memorable. From a film, and MCU standpoint, this is a weaker entry into the franchise. But as the credits rolled, I realized something. 

There's an argument to be made that 2019's CAPTAIN MARVEL is what gave Marvel Studios an insane level of cockiness. A movie that's fairly forgettable raked in over $1 billion. Not even WONDER WOMAN hit a billion, but then again, you could argue that fan hype for the DCEU was mixed and that movie gave folks the confidence to show up for CAPTAIN MARVEL. 

Still, I'm completely baffled by how successful this movie was, because I don't think it has any of the juice that acclaimed MCU films have, nor do I even consider it as engrossing or fun as other successful MCU movies like GOTG 2 and THOR RAGNAROK. I think coming off BLACK PANTHER and INFINITY WAR, Marvel was at an all-time high, but when ANT-MAN 2 grossed like $600 million, I thought, yeah that's probably where CAPTAIN MARVEL would end up. Of course, I was supremely wrong, and while I think it's amazing that the first female-led MCU movie proved to be a resounding success, I think Marvel took the wrong lessons from it and is now feeling the consequences (quality wise, not commercially in most cases). From there, Marvel was seen as an untouchable force that could put anything out and people would watch.

I don't even hate the movie, it just boggles my mind that it's a billion dollar hit. 

Again, this is all just my opinion, but to me, that was the movie that showed the studio that with minimal effort, any movie they make would be successful, only for the pandemic to happen... Phase 4, at least movie wise, had Marvel going back to its phase 1 roots with hiring experienced filmmakers to put their vision in line with whatever Feige was cooking up. It was a mixed bag tbh, and while a lot of films did well, others faired poorly critically and commercially (THOR 4, ANT-MAN 3, and several of the Disney+ shows are where I feel Marvel showed its cockiness and just put those things out thinking fans would blindly praise them). 

In the end, I'm much more interested in THE MARVELS, especially with Nia DaCosta at the helm, a strong writing team behind the script, and Larson showing in ENDGAME and even SHANG-CHI that she's way more comfortable in the role. Larson did not have great directors for CM 1 and they were not able to truly capture a consistent performance out of her. She's an Oscar winning actor... LET LARSON ACT!! She was great in ENDGAME and much more light in SHANG-CHI. I'm hoping this continues in MARVELS, and I know DaCosta is gonna get a great performance out of her + Teyonah and Iman. 

Hoping audiences turn out for it like they did with the first."

Took me quite a long time to try to put everything in order and type out all the episodes for each season so I decided to share my document with anyone else who wants it.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M8MjCCJlnYg1F4vVpiSs-eEymJRn5Vj3/edit?usp=drive\_link&amp;ouid=102615799688839386791&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M8MjCCJlnYg1F4vVpiSs-eEymJRn5Vj3/edit?usp=drive_link&amp;ouid=102615799688839386791&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)

I left our date watched and ratings in there as examples, but feel free to delete them and customize as you'd like.

I added the X-Men movies, Deadpools, the ""Sony Universe"", all the Spider-Man films and anything that I felt could be included in the MCU multiverse (for example: Toby Maguire was in the last Spider-Man so I added his movies too). However, I did not add any movies that are super old (before 2000) or the old Punisher movie with Thomas Jane, the old Hulks, Ghost Rider with Nicolas Cage, etc. I also did not add the old Fantastic Four series as I do not see a correlation with the current MCU multiverses.

I tried to make this list as close to a chronological timeline order as I could do WITHOUT spoiling anything in the end credit scenes. The movies that do not fit in chronologically will simply have to be ""flashback"" movies like Captain Marvel etc.

Feel free to let me know if I made any mistakes or if you think a certain movie/episode fits into a different spot on the list. It's pretty hard to place the Disney+ shows in the current Phase so I did my best.

Also. I suck at Excel... so if you want to customize it in any way or make it look cleaner / better in anyway I would love that."

3. This means that 838 X-Men are very likely similar to the 90s cartoon.  I know that's not much to go on, but it's something.
4. The bright yellow suit is based on the same yellow suit he work in the cartoon.

It's not solid, but it's enough for a theory."

Question about loki when the tva takes him,RepulsiveGround2558,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1536c2r/question_about_loki_when_the_tva_takes_him/,1689705083.0,"So we know in the original timeline loki never got the tessaract he was taken to asgard but in endgame tony goes somewhere and hulk comes in makes tony drop the tessaract which slides to loki and he takes it right.

So my thing is the tva would come and prune that timeline right before the nexus event happen but the tessaract would just go back to loki and there isn't a single scenario where he isn't picking it up again.

Do they expect loki to just not pick the tessaract up? Obviously tony was supposed to drop the tessaract in front of loki by mistake if that wasn't the case they would have taken him instead. So the tessaract would always land infront of loki and he's loki so he'll always take it.

Then it got me thinking when they reset the timeline what makes the variant not make the same choice that they made. Does the tva manipulate the environment so they make a different choice?"
Marvel screenwriters need better politics consultants,1stmingemperor,2307,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151qqqq/marvel_screenwriters_need_better_politics/,1689565696.0,"Action movie productions involving the military or spies often have ex-special forces people advising them on how the people these movies/shows are depicting are supposed to behave (see e.g. Sicario, Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, American Sniper), so that at least it’s not so far from reality that it disrupts the suspension of disbelief.

Marvel screenwriters really need consultants on how world politics works, because right now it’s hard to watch. Lots of the mistakes are so rudimentary that the lines are either written by 5-year-olds or with 5-year-olds as the target audience. At the end of FATWS, Cap gave that cringe speech chastising members of the GRC, and said something like “you control all the banks, so can’t you do XYZ” to the lady who I suppose is maybe the head of the World Bank or something similar. Well no, nobody just controls all the banks in the world, not even as a figure of speech of exaggeration. It’d be so much better if the language was toned down just a bit to “you’re the head of the World Bank, I’m sure you can do more to lend to countries struggling with refugees.”

Same with the skrull council scene in Secret Invasion a few weeks ago. One of the guys there said “I’m the commander of NATO, I can mobilize a million soldiers in a week” or something. That means he’s either replaced NATO’s Secretary General (Stoltenberg’s role), or SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe), neither of whom can just unilaterally mobilize other countries’ soldiers. Again, it’s not even something that’s plausible as a figure of speech.

It wasn’t a glaring issue before because “real world” politics rarely entered the MCU; even CAWS only involved fictional entities like SHIELD and the world security council. In Iron Man, POTUS and VP were more symbols than real people. It’s very different now and the lack of real understanding of just basic IR among the writers shows.

EDIT: just wanted to globally respond to comments along the lines of “this is a different universe” “it’s gotta be different with aliens and supers”. Like yes to an extent that is very true. I’m not picking a bone with how SHIELD, the World Security Council, SABER, or the Global Repatriation Council exist. But if the show’s going to tell us about NATO, then that should bear some resemblance to the NATO we know, or else that reference doesn’t mean anything at all. Or when the show references global finance (e.g. “control all the banks”), at least have some resemblance of how real world global finance works, please. If we as the audience lose all reference points to reality, then we won’t be able to follow the show when it attempts to reference reality. It’s that simple."
HOT TAKE: An alternate villain for 'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier',Dani_Wright03,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1538taw/hot_take_an_alternate_villain_for_the_falcon_and/,1689710717.0,"It's no secret that many people (myself included) were not so fond of the role Karli, and the Flag Smashers played on the show. Other than the failed attempts of the writers to make her sympathetic, I think it was just wasted potential. The show came out two years ago, and I've been thinking of a different villain who could've led more into the whole ""new world order"" thing that will happen in Captain America 4, as well as giving more depth and consequences to the Blip.

**The New Villain:**

Monica Rappaccini. She had a good role in the Avengers game, where it was also shown how she was determined to commit genocide on all the Inhumans while using A.I.M. to deceive the people with propaganda and false promises. Mix that with Hydra's plan to use the helicarriers to kill more than 700,000 people in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

**Alternate MCU Concept:**

In this case, Monica would become the new leader of A.I.M. after Aldrich Killian's death. She would develop a god complex and embrace social Darwinism, intensified by surviving the Snap. Monica believes the Snap purged the world of all weak links and begins to see the positive outcomes in the aftermath, such as the surviving population coming together or even nature healing from human impact. But after Bruce brings the other half back to life, the world is thrown into chaos, and Monica realises just how bad it gets. For instance, many kids who were adopted during those five years are forced to leave their adoptive families, many Snap survivors being displaced by the ones who came back, and overall, five years of positive progress made into nothing.

Monica would use A.I.M. to make a census of the blipped population, under the excuse that is for good intentions, while in reality, she's just making her list of victims. Unbeknownst to the government, Monica and her henchmen would also start creating an ""Anti-Blip"" campaign against the people who were brought back to life. Soon, she would receive huge support from Snap survivors, who also feel the same, while many Anti-Blip hate crimes and murders occur worldwide. At the same time, A.I.M. would be one of the main providers of supplies to the GRC refugee camps. Many of those said camps support Monica's plans to the point where she recruits several refugees to help commit terrorist attacks on the Blipped population.

But her main plan would be to commit a massacre at the GRC meeting council, killing many world leaders and blipped people on live television before revealing plans for a new world order where the remaining blipped would be hunted and executed similarly to Hydra's plan in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

Sam, Bucky, Sharon, and Zemo would've clashed with her over this, allowing Monica to show more of her manipulative side, such as guilt-tripping Bucky on how the world was better without him or trying to make Sam snap and go berserk. John Walker would fall victim to Monica's manipulation, making him lose the Captain America shield. In the end, Monica (in her Scientist Supreme suit) is defeated by Sam and Bucky, similar to how Steve defeated Tony in Civil War. Sam makes his speech on starting to help the Snap survivors before another ""Monica"" takes over, and Zemo's Alfred blows up Monica. But obviously, the Anti-Blip sentiment would not just fade away, impacting future shows, such as the Thanos was Right graffiti in Hawkeye. In a potential second post-credit scene, Monica is revealed to have cloned herself, and her clone is making a new deal with an unknown villain.

**End of concept**

This was such a long text, lol. Any villain alternatives and discussions are welcome, and I hope you liked this bizarre alternate version of the show."

1) Guardians of the Galaxy taking place in Andromeda. Just…why? Not only is it not ever mentioned, to my knowledge, but, what was wrong with using the Milky Way?  Baffling choice. 

2) It’s abundantly clear that Joss Whedon wrote certain parts of Age of Ultron in direct response to Man of Steel’s divisive reaction and the dialogue suffers for it. “Have we mentioned how much we want to save people? No? Let’s do it four more times so we can’t be criticized on the internet!”

3) WS is still a top five movie to me and the most rewatchable by far, but the idea that Nick Fury would miss the entirety of SHIELD being infiltrated by HYDRA is straight up nonsense. 

4) Rhodes still being a colonel is hilarious. Considering his exploits, he’d either be a high ranking official in the current presidential administration or if he Must be still active duty he’d have three stars at minimum.

What is with the pushback on Wakanda Forever?,Iwatchmovies2130,715,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151mj5l/what_is_with_the_pushback_on_wakanda_forever/,1689553699.0,"Personally, I loved BP2 and rank it within the top 10 of MCU all time. I thought the honors to Chadwick were handled beautifully and very well done + emotional. Plus, I thought Shuri taking up the mantle eventually was perfect and loved her progression as a character throughout the film. While in a perfect world, Chadwick is living great and playing T’Challa for years to come, Shuri as the next step is both logical and based in the comics. 

Additionally, I thought the directing, music, visuals, etc were all excellent and truly better than most MCU movies. Angela Basset’s work in particular is some of the best acting I’ve seen in the MCU. 

And Namor was an absolute great villain/antihero of sorts to me and I definitely want to see more of Talokan!! Seeing the country for the first time with Namor and Shuri was an awesome moment I thought. And the “RISE TALOKAN” chant was epic. The BP movies have been very dense in culture and I loved seeing that in a nation other than Wakanda. I found that most of Namor’s motivation made logical sense to me and he felt threatening. Killing Queen Ramonda definitely hurt. 

Also really liked Iron Heart! Wouldn’t necessarily say I am thru the roof excited for her show but I thought she was a fun addition to the story and want to see more. Her suit could’ve been a bit better tho fs and I get the complaint that she’s just a kid but I think that is a testament to her intelligence and honestly as the MCU expands, that’s kinda just something you have to get over. Tony Stark has created an AI, nanotech, and time travel so I think one kid building an iron man suit with a preset idea of what she’s making is not a huge jump. 

And we got a killmonger cameo!!! 

I do have some complaints with the movie tho. I think that the suits Okoye and Nakia wear in the final battle are pretty bad in design. And some of the backstory with Namor doesn’t always make entire sense to me but overall those are minor things. 

I really liked the US government stuff and found it to make sense and fit into the story well. This is a side to the MCU I personally enjoy, including in the Cap movies. However, I do understand the complaint that it felt unneeded, bland, and long. I didn’t feel that way tho. 

Overall, BP:WK was one of my fav MCU movies since endgame, just under nwh. I felt that it actually had STAKES + WEIGHT- 2 things which I have felt very lacking in the Multiverse saga thus far. Humor was definitely present, but it did not rely on it NEARLY to the extent that 95% of the MCU does. So anyways, I feel like I am kinda in the minority with this opinion, and I can’t figure out why. I hear talk that it was generic, bland, too long, etc but I disagree entirely. 

What are others thoughts??"

But in broader picture, we can understand Val's motivation in building Thunderbolts team, to counter this type of situations, where superheroes or Shield agents don't consult or put on notice government officials. And in doing so, they potentially risking countless lives in the process.

It would also give Everett Ross and Val more debt and screen time. Imagine Val's reaction that at least for some time Everett was Scroll and her inner conflict figuring out when it happened. It also has opportunity to give her more sympathetic characteristics such as: trying to find Ross alive and well.
