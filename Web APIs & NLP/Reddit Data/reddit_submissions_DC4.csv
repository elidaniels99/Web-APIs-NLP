"Weekly Discussion Thread: Comics, TV, and More! [July 31, 2023 - I Lived Through the Knight Terrors and All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt Edition]",beary_neutral,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/15dx80u/weekly_discussion_thread_comics_tv_and_more_july/,1690752894.0,"Hey there honorary Justice League members - it’s a new week which means it’s time for a new discussion thread!

- Beary's pick of the week: [*City Boy* #3](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/912cWvjuX1L.jpg)

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

I think I recall he might have worn a white suit and had some weird gear around his eyes. There was some post apocalyptic scenario that made the region outside his control unsafe. There a Batman controlled the region outside of the region he controlled. I think at the conclusion of the story they found out they were both clones and stuck in a cycle of fighting each other.

I kinda liked it, so I've watched Man of Steel and director's cut of BvS. At first I liked it, but then I've watched ""The Batman"" (2022) and really enjoyed the Batman-detective storyline. It was then that I realised I stopped liking Snyder's take on the character. Then I've rewatched Nolan's trilogy and despite it not being quite what I would have wanted (The Batman is still my favourite Batman movie), I enjoyed it and understood that in the end I don't like Snyderverse at all.

So, in the meantime I've read my first ever DC comic ""Flashpoint"". That may not have been a very wise starting point, but I've really enjoyed it nevertheless Then I've read Watchmen, because I knew it's a pretty self-contained story, and it was an unbelievable lifetime experience. That was when I've truly decided that I would like to explore the world of DC comics more.

So, the question is: what main DC universe comic books should I start off with? Personally, I like Batman, Flash and Green Lantern the most, also maybe Superman.

Gotham War will Break-Up the Bat-Family,MagisterPraeceptorum,320,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/15cq8ne/gotham_war_will_breakup_the_batfamily/,1690630934.0,"The autumn 2023 event *Gotham War* is most likely going to break-up the extended Bat-family for the next number of years[.](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/5407168/batman-138) 

**DC’s History of Breaking Up the Bat-family**

This is something DC has done about every decade since the concept of the extended Bat-family was first introduced. By “extended Bat-family” I mean the Bat-family from the mid-1990s onward following *Knightfall* when it stopped being mainly just Batman, Robin, and Alfred, and began to reincorporate characters like Oracle and Nightwing as well as more vigilantes like Azrael and the Huntress as part of a recurring team. The first time DC broke up the extended family was in 2004 with the *War Games* storyline. The second time was in 2013 during the New 52 following the *Death of the Family* crossover and the death of Damian Wayne (rapidly compounded in the years immediately following with the falsified death of Dick Grayson and amnesia plot for Bruce Wayne). 

Now in 2023 we are “due” for another big Bat-family falling out and *Gotham War* is likely to do just that. Probably as part of what will launch the new slew of Dawn of DC Bat-family titles. *Gotham War*’s press releases have already stated it will “fracture the Bat-family” and do so in “dramatic ways.” Initially, it appeared this event would only exasperate pre-existing fractures between Batman and his associates. Namely Catwoman, Red Hood, Batwoman, and Batwing. However the solicit and cover for *Batman* #138 displays Batman and Nightwing fighting as part of the war, which shows this is something much more serious.

**Batman and Nightwing** 

Since the end of the “Ric Grayson” travesty, the relationship between Batman and Nightwing has arguably been stronger than it’s ever been. Recently emphasized by the heartfelt moment between them in *Nightwing* #100. Arguably no other character since the loss of Alfred is closer to Bruce in the current continuity than Dick. The depiction of Batman and Nightwing fighting on *Batman* #138 is no doubt cover bait. Batman could very well not be Bruce Wayne but Zur-en-Arrh, or the actual conflict between Bruce and Dick will be far less violent. Regardless though, Batman and Nightwing’s relationship will take a step back following *Gotham War*. Bruce, Dick, and the rest of the family may need to rally to defeat a bigger “ancient” threat at the end of the event, but once the dust settles things between them will be worse off, not better. 

**Zdarsky’s Deconstruction of Batman**

Zdarsky is retreading the same shtick that every modern Batman writer can’t seem to escape from. Deconstructing Batman down to a lowest point so he can, supposedly, be reconstructed stronger and better. I had hoped Zdarsky would follow the example of the *Knightfall* saga, *No Man’s Land*, and Grant Morrison’s run in this regard where Bruce’s low point/turning point happens within the first third or quarter of the overall narrative. For Zdarsky I thought that was when Failsafe sent Bruce to another universe. Alas, *Gotham War* shows that this was not the case. We are still in the “decline and fall” deconstruction phase. Which means Zdarsky is making the same error as *Bruce Wayne Fugitive*, the *Infinite Crisis* saga, and Tom King’s run. The low point/turning point is going to come far too late, meaning the reconstruction is going to be rushed, unearned, unsatisfying, and ultimately won’t survive the run. It is far easier to deconstruct and tear down a fictional character. Is is much more difficult to engage in reconstruction and build a character back up stronger. More than likely, Zdarsky’s Batman won’t be on the “upswing” until 2025 and it will likely only be in the final arc or so of this run that Bruce and the extended family mend fences. 

**Conclusion**

So get ready for lonely, ultra-broody, unpleasant Batman for the next few years Bat-fans. Aside from Damian Wayne Robin (whose rift with Batman has recently resolved for the new *Batman and Robin*
title), the rest of the Bat-family isn’t going to be on good terms with Bruce for a good long while. 

I had hoped with Dawn of DC that the Bat books had moved past this sort of thing. Especially with the Superman, Flash, and Green Arrow titles embracing their superhero families. The Batman world unfortunately remains stuck in the regressive narrative tendencies that have plagued it since the turn of the millennium."

I was looking through some listings of older series a little while back, and I was reminded of just how much of a presence Green Lantern had during the early to mid-2010s. It seems so weird compared to the brand's relatively limited presence these days.

DC started off the New 52 with *four* ongoing Green Lantern titles:

[Green Lantern](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-lantern/4050-42808/?sortBy=asc)

[Green Lantern Corps](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-lantern-corps/4050-42916/?sortBy=asc)

[Green Lantern: New Guardians](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/green-lantern-new-guardians/4050-43007/?sortBy=asc)

[Red Lanterns](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/red-lanterns/4050-42804/?sortBy=asc)

These I can definitely understand. This was in November of 2011, and the Green Lantern film had been in theaters earlier that summer. The character would be fresh in people’s minds, so it’s pretty expected that DC would want to capitalize on that.

What's especially impressive/surprising to me though is that *all of these* reached 40 issues, and made it to the end of the New 52 imprint in March of 2015, so it's not like they were quick throwaways or anything. These were active, ongoing stories with (presumably) a significant audience. That being said, only the solo GL title continued into that weird ""Still the New 52, but we're not calling it that anymore"" limbo era, and hit issue #52.

Later on, while all of these four titles were still being published, two *more* series were added:

[Sinestro](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/sinestro/4050-73088/?sortBy=asc)

[Larfleeze](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/larfleeze/4050-64231/?sortBy=asc) (Fucking Larfleeze got his own book. Fucking *Larfleeze*.)

These two weren't miniseries, but didn't have as much longevity as the others. Sinestro only lasted 20-something issues, and Larfleeze got about half that. Sinestro started in April of 2014, and the last issue of Larfleeze came out in June of 2014. So they only had three months of overlap, but during those three months, there were SIX ongoing Green Lantern titles.

With all of these, plus the film, plus the animated series, GL had a pretty crazy run in the first half of the decade. This probably speaks to my age, but that's kind of weird to think about considering how the franchise only has one ongoing right now (with another on the way.) It would be awesome to see more stuff like this come back, maybe whenever *Lanterns* comes out. The Green Lantern section of the DC universe is freaking huge, and I feel like it lends itself to five or six ongoing titles better than a lot of other parts of the DCU.

Honestly, I don't know where I'm really going with this. What do *you* think about the fact that there was a brief point in time where there were six ongoing Green Lantern-related titles?"

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

I believe I read some snippet or maybe it was in the back of the comic where Miller said that he was always one of those people who thought Batman could beat Superman, so it seems like this idea was around long before his comic. 

So is there anything to point to as where the idea of Batman beating Superman came from or was this just something comic fans always argued about amongst themselves back when?"

I would not mind seeing him date Harley Quinn I think that would be an interesting relationship to explore.

I would only want to see this relationship if Harley Quinn was going down the path of becoming an anti hero or was already operating as an anti hero.

- I would just like to add my interest in maybe seeing this couple did not come from that Batman and Harley Quinn animated movie.
It actually came from the Arkham Knight Harley Quinn DLC were I thought both are sidekicks and that this could be interesting relationship."

I have some questions about Batman Beyond. Now just so you know, I like all of the DCAU shows and that they are all great. 

The first question is, is it true that people think the first season and Return of the Joker is what made the show great?

The second question, is what do they think of the second and third seasons of Batman Beyond? 

Next, is how much of a difference in quality is there between the first season &amp; Return of the Joker together and seasons 2 &amp; 3 together?

I am asking these questions because in my poll topics, the majority likes Batman Beyond more than Superman: The Animated Series, but without the first season of Batman Beyond and Return of the Joker, they liked Superman: The Animated Series more than Batman Beyond, although Superman: The Animated Series was also winning against  Batman Beyond Season 1 in another one of my polls."

For this I wanted to do a fun thought experiment with fellow DC fans! Pitch me a film idea. It doesn’t have to be super fleshed out, but at the very least, tell me your basic idea. Just a few requirements.

Protagonist(s): Who is our central character(s)? Which hero, team, or villain do you want to be the focus of film?

Themes: What themes do you want in the film? How do they pertain to the chosen featured character?

Supporting cast: Sidekicks, family members, friends, or other people of interest to the film. A hero still needs a healthy supporting cast!

Antagonist(s): Who or what is the central obstacle to the protagonist’s story? Is it a villain from their normal villain gallery, or another character/group that thematically fits the hero through similarities or contrast?

I do have several ideas myself, but didn’t want to bombard this sub with these kinds of posts. I brainstormed ideas about Red Tornado, Metamorpho, the Ray, Animal Man, and even Man-Bat. Not all of these are fleshed out, but I still love thinking about these ideas.

And then have nightwing take up the mantle for years if not a decade. I think it would be a huge shift for DC and add a lot to dick Graysons character. I know it’s been done before but I think having this happen for years would really give them time to have a whole new mantle and a reflection on Bruce being gone. Thoughts on this?

Help me understand the DC multiverse (Essential Reading).,Curryfor30,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/15c9qrx/help_me_understand_the_dc_multiverse_essential/,1690579694.0,"Hi all. I've been reading DC for a handful of years now after growing up a Marvel kid. One thing that's really stopped me from delving further is how the multiverse is laid out. Currently reading the Sinestro Corps War for instance, and all the talk of Henshaw's travels through the Source Wall, through the bleed, and the knowledge of the 52 universes is making my head spin. 

I've read a good bit of major DC events through multiple era's, could someone supply an essential reading list to understand what is happening? I've got:

Crisis on Infinite Earths - Totally understandable. You got a bunch of earths, and at the end everythings mostly on one. 

Infinite Crisis/52 - Okay, so it's the reverse...we had 1 earth and now it's back to a multiverse with 52 earths. 

Countdown (HAVENT READ)- I've heard this ""isn't canon"", but so many of the stories I've read from 06-08 refrence events in this, and some big mystery unraveling. Lots of appearances from the monitors, who I feel like we havent seen since the og crisis. During this time it feels like theres a lot of hopping between universes. Just read an issue where Captain Atom talks about going to the Authority universe for a bit, and then hanging out in the Tangent universe. 

Final Crisis- Even though it's a Crisis this ultimately feels detached from all the multiverse shenanigans? Darkseid invades and takes over earth, Supes ultimately saves the day after a little side adventure with the Legion(s) of Superheroes. 

Flashpoint - Okay, new continuity prime earth. Got that. Is there still a 52 earth multiverse out there ""beyond the source wall""? What exactly changed?

Rebirth - New 52 just kind of flows into this, things start looking and feeling similar to Post Crisis continuity, but nothings actually happened or changed for any of these characters (other than Supes), what was the catalyst for all this? Are all the post crisis versions just gone(after convergence), and these are the versions of characters we'll have now?

Doomsday Clock/Superman Reborn - This is where I start to get completely confused. Superman Reborn's finale has the 2 Supermen merge into one, and supposedly the post crisis and N52 continuities merged as well? Then Doomsday Clock's finale says ""everything happened!"", which again seems similar. No idea how all this plays out in actuality. 

Multiversity - Read this once a few years ago, had no clue wtf was going on. Ended with a big map of the multiverse that makes no sense to me.

Dark Knights Metal/Death Metal - Read the first issue of Metal, realized it was going back to the multiversal concepts that made my head spin, and put it down to read another time. 

Infinite Frontier (HAVEN'T READ) - Seems like it's doubling down on the whole ""everything happened"" concept? I see summary's or solicits for current issues and think ""that doesn't make any sense timeline-wise"". Does this make everything more or less confusing? 

Dark Crisis - Actually did read this one, but it wasn't very good. Last few issues has the return(?) of the multiverse. Isn't that what Infinite Crisis did? Where did it go? Ends with that Big Bang issue from Waid where he lists all the diffrent worlds. Again, how is this diffrent from IC/52?

Thank you so much, all of this has been a barrier to entry for me into exploring the DC universe more, it just feels like the more recent, the more complex it all gets."

Early DC is bounded by the creation of Superman and Crisis on Infinite Earths. The following era of DC was defined by its darker moments like Death of Superman and Knightfall. It also has some of the superhero origin stories that many consider to be the definitive character mythos like John Byrne’s Man of Steel series. That era ends with Infinite Crisis and the re-expansion of the DC multiverse.

What happens next? What stories are important and define that era of DC leading into Final Crisis? And again, what are the key tonal events that define the post Final Crisis era?

Flashpoint and New 52 are easier to follow again, but what was the continuity changing event after that? Metal? Death Metal?

I’m reading through the crisis events, but I generally don’t understand what happens between them with the exception of what I’ve currently read up to, and Flashpoint/New 52."

And it's basically read-made.

Superman has his Super Family.

Batman has the Bat-Fam plus Batman Incorporated plus direct ties to Birds of Prey and also The Outsiders

Wonder Woman has other Wonder Women/Girls and various Amazons.

The Flash has his squad of fellow speedsters.

GL has the Corps.

Aquaman has his crew of fellow Aqua-Peeps.

Martian Manhunter is the only one really lacking a squad of his own but imagine him leading a team of the likes of SHAZAM, Captain Atom, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Apollo, Midnighter, Barda, Mr Miracle, The Atom, Animal Man, Firestorm, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, etc. 

I just feel like there are a lot of great characters not getting a lot of spotlight, and beyond the old good guy versus bad guy scenarios, team books are also great for highlighting the interpersonal relationships of the heroes on the team which can make for some really compelling reading."

Without knowing how to use his new powers, he became Superman's apprentice. He learned how to be a Kryptonian and became somewhat of Superman's sidekick. After Jason saved superman from a kryptonite blast shot by Lex Luthor, he was kidnapped by the villain and held captive for over a year. His only hope was that superman would come and save the now paralyzed Jason Todd from his daily torture by Luthor. Superman never came. After his death, Jason was ressurected in a Lazarus pit. His genetic code was reset to human because of his ressurection. With the knowledge of the things he had seen in the year captive at Lexcorp, he made a iron suit to emulate Superman's powers, donning the name ""Steel"". Blaming Superman for never saving him from his demise, Jason vowed to get his revenge. Eventually finding out that superman got intel of Jason's death, and therefore never saving him, Jason decided to become a crime fighter once more, but to lay justice using his own code, in his own way."

And while a completely unique movie that isn't based on any pre-existing story would probably be preferable, I do agree with the popular opinion that the Flashpoint story needs to be put to rest. We now have a comic, an animated movie, a tv-show, and a movie (which not many people watched and mainly gets memed for its microwave scene, but whatever) all telling the Flashpoint story. It's a great story, but unless if you're going to take advantage of &gt;!Thomas Wayne's Batman or Martha Wayne's Joker!&lt; why tell yet another version of this story when there are undoutably countless other Flash stories worthy of getting big-budget attention too.

Outcast from his race and tribe for being a weirdo, he makes it his mission to save his concept of humanity, as of course this conflicted boring dude has nothing better to do—and this gives him a redeeming quality to reflect on his ethics: “I am Batman, but I am not really a man; I am a lonely vampire that likes to drain you dry, but oh well, I must try to make up for last night’s bloody mischievous misdeeds by saving this poor idiot who’s on their phone instead of watching the road.”  Make him savage, brutal, a bloodsucking machine that loses himself in the span of the night as the vampire he is (and glide and sleep like actual bats do, not like some stiff terminator). To ‘repent’ his nightly carnage, make him suck the bad folks of the city or to whatever holy grail mission he’s set on. This way he is still boring, but somewhat not Jizzus."

"So, I just recentlyly saw The Batman for the first time....",StarMayor_752,624,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/159p5jz/so_i_just_recentlyly_saw_the_batman_for_the_first/,1690328427.0,"...and I enjoyed it immensely. It was a noir film. It had levity, but not to the detriment of its serious tone. I was invested in the characters' performances. I believe this is one of the best iterations of Batman I've seen. As someone who enjoys the detective stories, this was great.

I remember there being discussions about Riddler's end plan being antithetical to his message. I don't know if I agree or if I disagree yet, but I do think I understand his plan. To me, the Riddler's goal was always to pay the city back for failing him and others like him. I think his final choice, however chaotic, still feels in line with trying to expose them as liars.

In a way, Riddler's final act is about a defeatist philosophy that simply escalates: with the right situation, no matter how good they try to be, the citizens of Gotham could never overcome everything if the right obstacle came along (&gt;!hence the flooding!&lt;). Even then, Batman still leads the people into the light and they succeed, proving to the Riddler that Gotham is worth saving. It just needed somebody to show it how to be better.

I also enjoyed Batman/Bruce's journey. His realization, first at conversing with Riddler, and then at hearing the one Riddler goon's line that mirrors his own was a fantastic way of developing him. Bruce realizing that being Batman isn't just about being shadows but also standing as a pillar of light in a dark city is a way of making him more interesting. That characterization gives way for a much more interesting nuance. We usually only see the dichotomy, but this movie offered a fully invested Bat, so it'll be that much more rewarding to see Pattinson switch into and out of his Bruce and Batman personal.

TLDR; Great movie. Pattinson was wonderful. Riddler was complex. I'm excited for the next one. Reeves did well."

Addition some of the myths online include 

1. Fairy Tale of Nanga Parbat: One local legend tells the story of a fairy who lived on the mountain and would abduct handsome young men from nearby villages. The fairy's beauty and allure were said to be irresistible, and those who fell under her spell would never return.

2. Rebellious Mountain: Nanga Parbat is often referred to as the ""Killer Mountain"" due to the high number of fatalities among climbers attempting to conquer its treacherous slopes. Some local residents believe that the mountain is cursed or has a vengeful spirit, and it takes the lives of those who dare to challenge its might.

3. Divine Presence: In some local beliefs, Nanga Parbat is considered a sacred mountain with a divine presence. It is believed to be the dwelling place of gods or ancestral spirits, and locals offer prayers and perform rituals to seek blessings and protection.

4. Nanga Parbat as a Test: Some tales describe Nanga Parbat as a place of trials and tests for individuals seeking enlightenment or redemption. Those who are pure of heart and pass the challenges presented by the mountain are said to gain wisdom and spiritual insight.

5. Folklore of Lost Cities: The region around Nanga Parbat is also rich in folklore about hidden cities or ancient civilizations that were once thriving but disappeared mysteriously."

He also talks a lot of cues from Hitchcock films that really drive home that film noir vibe. Book 9 is a fever pitch of paranoia that feels like the master of suspense directed it himself. 

TL;DR if you like less mainstream, quirky offbeat stories definitely give this book a read! It’s fantastic and hopefully wins some awards for it’s artwork."

To me, I would say Justice League Season 2 this time, because compared to Season 1 of Justice League, the stories, episodes and character dynamics are better than Batman Beyond or Justice League Season 1 even though I think those are great too.

 1. She often fights gods/demigods and therefore she either can’t or isn’t allowed to kill them.

2. Being allowed to be on the JL means they require her to not kill anyone (Superman reprimands her right after she said it in this N52 situation)

3. Her villains (like Cheetah) or often tragedy characters so she claims “oh yea I kill” and then only faces villains she wants to help bc they turned that way on accident/outside their own control."

August 2023 Book Club Nomination: All Ages,Predaplant,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/15972gh/august_2023_book_club_nomination_all_ages/,1690287992.0,"Here, we'll vote for the book to be featured in the August Book Club. You may nominate or upvote books that you wish to discuss. **Do not nominate more than one book, and do not post a duplicate nomination.**    

Like with our Character of the Month polls, each poll will have a particular theme or category. This month's category is: **All Ages**, in which books that are suitable for anyone to read regardless of age are eligible.

Guidelines for book eligibility are as follows:  

- The book must be widely available in-print. This means that I should be able to go to an online retailer like Amazon, InStockTrades, or Book Depository and buy it without paying an exorbitant markup. 

- The book must be available digitally (ie, Comixology, DC Universe, or Hoopla Digital), either as a complete collection or individual issues. It must be available through **legal means**; do not post a piracy site.  
- The book should be reasonably affordable. Paperback trades, hardcovers, and Deluxe Editions are fine. Absolutes and Omnibuses are not.  
- If you're nominating a story arc, be sure to include the trade where it's collected. Do not nominate a single issue or Annual.  
- Limit your nomination to a single collection or graphic novel. Don't just nominate an entire run; pick out one particular volume. Under certain circumstances, we may allow two volumes from a single creative run to be nominated, if they're reasonably short and tell a complete story (e.g., a 12-issue mini-series split up into two trades). However, this is left to moderator discretion.  
- Anything published by DC is eligible. That includes main-line comics, graphic novels, imprints (such as Vertigo), media tie-ins, and others.  
- Only nominate a book if you're genuinely interested in reading and discussing it. There's no prize for picking the most popular answer.

I jumped in at the Dark Nights event and have been buying the TPBs. When checking Wikipedia, I think I need to start reading Year of the Villain. However, the two TPBs (Hell Arisen and The Infected) don't seem to cover all the comics, namely about 8 of the villain one shots.

Can we expect a TPB for them? Or is it normal for some issues just not to get one?

bruce wayne having 4 children is not a strange thing,Which-Presentation-6,120,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/158d868/bruce_wayne_having_4_children_is_not_a_strange/,1690211043.0,"there  come robin, and every now and then a fan appears asking what the public thinks about bruce adopting so many children, but from an in-universe perspective it is not strange the various adoptions of bruce wayne.

first bruce goes to a circus where two acrobats are killed in front of their son, bruce who went through the same kind of tragedy decides to adopt young dick grayson so that he would not be alone.

years pass and dick grayson leaves gotham to go to college, about a year later by chance jason todd a delinquent tries to steal bruce wayne's car, luckily the billionaire ends up being understanding with the child and puts her in a boarding school for young people in his same situation, but after some problems with the administration bruce decides to adopt him, unfortunately the joker kidnaps jason's missing mother and he recklessly goes to save her and dies (but a few years later it is discovered that he was kidnapped and death was faked)

more years passed and bruce never adopted another orphan the most he did was to have as a disciple and the son of an upper class archaeologist, tim drake but a few years later tim's father is murdered and his stepmother goes into a state which makes it impossible for her to take care of tim who was a teenager, bruce has known him since he was a child so he decides to adopt him.

and finally bruce is known to be a playboy who has had relationships with several women, so him having an illegitimate child with a middle east socialite who wants to keep her identity a secret so as not to be harassed by the public is not something unbelievable in fact it would beg the question if damian wayne is bruce wayne's only biological child.

in nutshell bruce wayne having 4 children 3 adopted and a biological one is not something strange, it happened in very long periods of time and with logical explanations for these events.

and as a bonus we have cassandra cain who, despite the father-daughter relationship, cass was never publicly adopted by bruce wayne since cass herself is not concerned with having a public identity."

So we watched batman begins and when it got to the part where Bruce’s parents die I heard him yell “Jesus I didn’t know his parents die”.

When I asked if he was joking he told me he wasn’t. Somehow in the 50 years my dad has been alive he had somehow missed the most famous origin story in pop culture.

Anyway he likes Batman begins but we didn’t finish it. We’re gonna finish it tomorrow

I am aware there are many places one can start when it comes to reading comics, and that a lot of people prefer digital comics or graphic novels so they can binge any story without interruption.

But I am actually really interested in the idea of following a new comic, and picking it up issue by issue as it comes out. 

I am thinking of starting with Batman Beyond: Neo Gothic, where issue 1 comes out tomorrow. (I watched Batman Beyond the cartoon as a kid, so this is not totally random for me). Are there any other suggestions that people have, either that have just started or is expected to start soon? 

I am looking for a series that I can jump into now, so something with 10 issues released already may not be for me (or do some people like jumping into the middle of a series and trying to figure out what is going on?). I am aware I wouldn't have this problem if I just grabbed a graphic novel but the idea of reading issue by issues as it comes out is what is intriguing me currently."

Everything I heard about this movie was negative. However I recently I watched WW 2017 and I decided to start watching the DCEU in chronological order which would make WW84 next. I thought ""what do I have to lose?"" I don't know if it was because the bar for me was really low but I ended up loving the movie.

I liked the opening of this movie how it was foreshadowing the message of the movie. I liked Barbara's character and it was disappointing (her character not the writing) seeing her downfall and becoming cheetah. I thought Max Lord was a good villain. He very much felt  very 80s and comic booky but at the same time so real because of his relationship with his son. I loved the ending when he takes back his wish to save his son. Steve Trevor was back and I loved every moment (except when they sleep together, we don't talk about that). It was wholesome and seeing him and Diana together for the first time after the war. And of course I enjoyed watching Wonder Woman herself. From the action scenes to her own character arc, having to give up her only wish to save the world. 

Overall I understand why people don't like this movie but to me it was a fun enjoyable popcorn movie.   Yes this movie had many flaws for example there is so many problems that can happen with the wishes.  But at the end of the day I enjoyed the movie and that's really the point of movies at the end of the day."

Everyone already excepts that the third and fourth movies are trash but Id like to argue the first and second films aren’t much better Lex Luther is a great villain for superman with how he fights him using awesome tech and suits to counteract superman‘s powers in the comics. However, this Lex Luthor is kind of just a rich guy. All he has is kryptonite, and it makes for a not very not entertaining villain, hero dynamic. Not once throughout the movie that I feel like Superman was in any danger, even when he brought out kryptonite and his whole villainous scheme is kind of silly like who’s gonna be buying beachfront property after millions of people just died there. Superman to has a lot of problems. You think it would be far more enjoyable because he’s now facing villains who can actually threaten him but they barely interact and he gives up his powers super early on, and the ridiculous powers they give super man and the other kryptonian’s are so weird not just the giant cellophane s he throws but the random like cloning and intangibility, or the lasers coming out of their hands it’s stupid. And I know they were very limited due to when they came out but I think the Adam West Batman had better fight choreography. At least Adam West Batman had a variety of villains from the comics and despite also being goofy and campy you still get a lot of moments where he does things that Batman actually does. I guess it just goes to show how quickly these movies evolved as within nearly 10 years later the 89 Batman movie drastically improved the superhero genre but I guess Batman always pushes the envelope."

So as it’s explained in the movie, John explains that the reason why Apocalypse attacked earth was because of flashpoint, when Barry went back in time to save his mother. At the end of the movie we learn that the earth is doomed and can’t be saved. So John says to flash that he knows what he needs to do. He needs to create another flashpoint In order it save the earth and everyone else. My question is, what events did Barry change I order to stop apocalypse from invading the earth. Was it something small or some big Event that he changed? I trust looking it up but can’t find anything that helps. Hopefully you guys can provide some light on this question."

He has orange or yellow goggles and a bunch of blonde hair on top of his head.  The yellow part of his costume has a polka-dot pattern.

he almost looks like a teenage version of Booster Gold (or maybe Animal Man), but he is not those characters.  I thought that it might be a version of the Flash villain Trickster, but I looked all over the images of his different costumes and nothing matched.  Can someone help me out please? "

- When it comes to the first live action version of Harley Quinn she was alright but I felt she was more Dr. Harleen Quinzel then Harley Quinn. 

How did you feel about Huntress not having a secret identity or doing very little to have a secret identity?

- I was not a huge fan of her not having a secret identity or of her doing very little to have a secret identity. I mean all I could think about is how GCPD has not figured out her identity I mean I know they are corrupt but this is ridiculous.

**For those who don't know:** the way this works is that several comments will list this week’s releases, for any given title discussion you should respond to that comment. For example, *Wonder Woman* discussion would go in the replies to the ""Wonder Woman"" comment. Clicking the titles in this post will take you directly to that comment, too.

In other words, you should only be replying to other comments. If you have trouble understanding how to comment for a particular title, please refer to this [handy guide](http://i.imgur.com/NMABCqS.gif). Any unwarranted top level comments will be removed. 

Also, please refrain from posting short, low-content comments on threads for issues or episodes that have not yet been released. Put some effort to generate discussion. Instead of just posting ""So excited!"" or ""Best book!"", try something with a bit more substance, like ""Punchline is such an amazing character! Can't wait to see how they explore her in more depth in this issue.""

Most websites said to read 'Batman: The Man Who Laughs' next, and so I did. I got confused because on the last page of 'Batman: Year One' Jim Gordon says that the Joker has threatened to poison Gotham's water supply. But in 'Batman: The Man Who Laughs', which supposedly accours some time after Year One, Batman and Jim hasn't found out about Joker's plans yet. But I just ignored it and enjoyd the read. Then i went on to 'Batman: Haunted Knight' after, because most websites said that it was next in line. But in that story, Batman has apparently fought Scarecrow multiple times, and Batman Also mentions that he has fought Two-Face before. 
So now i'm just confused. What did I miss?

Question: Do criminals fear Robin?,2K20BJJ,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1573vjt/question_do_criminals_fear_robin/,1690083299.0,"Now of course, many Gothamites and criminals alike fear the Dark Knight, and think Batman is somehow supernatural, some form of creature of the night or vampire, especially before he joins the JL and so. 

Obviously, I know the fear around Robin isn't as big, but is there at least some form of fear from criminals and/or regular people? I would imagine that (especially for criminals), if Batman is some mystic cryptid or dark creature, his sidekick who runs around demolishing criminals with him must be some form of little creature or something along those lines as well. I mean if I saw Robin beating a bunch of criminals with Batman I would be scared as hell, doesn't matter if he's a teen.

 And even fore those who believe Batman's ""just a man"", he's one hell of a tough and intimidating man. Would that intimidation and fear factor carry over to the Robin?

I think one scene in Titans (the CW show) where Jason Todd (as Robin) fights a few GCPD officers in a dark warehouse handles this quite well. He brutally beats the cops, and it's shown clear they are scared of his next move. Then this one shot of Robin hunting down the last officer and sneaking up on him, reflects the cop's fear and Robin's own intimidation factor quite well."

I had no idea at the time that it was part of a tv show and I just wanted more of this insane goofy fun version of a character I was often disinterested in due to him being portrayed as so dark and depressing in everything that wasn't Lego.

I bought the whole show and the massive collection of comics that were released recently. I'm also glad to know there's a comic line covering the Wonder Woman 1977 show (which I'm sure I'll watch one day), and the 1978 Superman movie series and 1989 Batman movie series. (There's also a fan-made pilot for a Superman 55 comic- checking out that tv show has gone up on my priority list after the wonderful cameo it had in The Flash movie which I shall defend till my last dying breath.)

So my question is, which comic series would you want to see next? Batman 05? Superman 13? Flash 90? Green Lantern 11? Maybe something even older like the 1940s Superman and Batman serials? I'd love a good Lego Batman Comic any day. And what crossovers might you want to see?"

\-Batman stopping for drive-thru (he offered the fries to Gordon), performing CPR on drunken sailors, and trying to ram his remote-controlled Batmobile through the gates of Arkham Asylum... only to have it get blown up by a landmine.  
\-Superman saving a scientist from being murdered and using his superspeed to become invisible (thanks to a power stunt), before swinging one armored henchman into another so hard that both their battlesuits shattered.  
\-Batman and Superman teaming up with Joker and Lex, respectively, to save the cities from destruction.  
\-Superman mistaking the League of Shadows for the culprits... which resulted in Byrne-era Lex Luthor learning about their existence and forming an alliance with Ra's Al Ghul after the conclusion.

Let's face it, comics can be confusing. No matter how big or small your question may be this is the place to ask and /r/DCcomics will do our best to answer it for you!

As the /r/DCcomics community continues to grow we are receiving an influx questions from readers of DC comics, or simply new readers to comics entirely. As Stan Lee has said, every comic book is someone's first, and even though he maybe be one of those [other guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/marvel) it certainly applies here as well. With this spirit in mind, these Q'n'A topics are intended to give those who may be puzzled a centralized place to connect with other knowledgable readers and clear up some confusion.

A new Ask the Veterans thread is posted every Sunday, and in the future answers to these questions will be organized into this subreddit's wiki page.

**To those answering**

Avoid vague replies like ""yes"" or ""no"". Rather do your best to explain your answer, and if necessary provide a link that may help anyone interested in learning more. Remember to &gt;!hide spoilers!&lt; when discussing major events that have taken place within one year of its release..

"Extremely obscure fan theory for a continuity that's been dead for 40+ years: Hal Jordan's (GL's) dad is a alternate version of Larry Jordan, the Golden Age Air Wave. No I don't care if you don't care.",Androktone,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1573ceh/extremely_obscure_fan_theory_for_a_continuity/,1690081646.0,"(Talking Pre Crisis only) So the reason for this theory is due to the character of Larry Jordan (that last name will have significance) being created in 1942. He's the first DC superhero to use the name Air Wave.

He disappeared for a long time until after DC had switched continuities by creating (or I guess quietly switching to the quietly separate Earth of Superboy's) Earth-1. Then in Hal Jordan's Green Lantern title they introduced the original Air Wave's son, Hal Jordan (yes this is too complicated) who became the new Air Wave of the League's generation. This means that Larry Jordan, Air Wave II's father, mentioned to now be dead, must be brothers with the father of Hal Jordan, Green Lantern II, who we know is called Martin (I think, I'm pretty sure the writers only settled on that name later but idk) Jordan.

Later, in 1983, we got a story where Air Wave II and Superman teamed up. That's all well and good and doesn't raise any questions. Obviously Hal Jordan's cousin is on the same Earth as him. But in the issue they show a flashback where the original Air Wave, Larry, teams up with Superboy, the same Superman only younger.

This would imply that Larry Jordan only existed on Earth-1, which isn't contradicted by the original 1940s comics, where Air Wave had no connection to the Justice Society or anyone from Earth-2, other than the out of universe fact his stories were backups to stories set in that continuity. Though if those stories were set in Earth-1's 1940s, it would be notable since most assume Earth-1's World War 2 did not include superheroes in its progression and more resembled real history.

But that changed in the All-Star Squadron comic from 1984, which is set in Earth-2's 1940s. There we see that Larry Jordan, Air Wave is hanging out and involved in the Justice Society, a contemporary to Jay Garrick and Alan Scott.

This either means a) there's a Larry Jordan of 2 worlds, just as there are near identical counterparts to Bruce Wayne, Wonder Woman, and Green Arrow. Or b) at some point Larry Jordan jumped from Earth-2 over to Earth-1. I don't think there's a doppelganger of Larry on both Earths because it's never mentioned, and it would mean Earth-2 Larry literally only appeared for 3 issues and who's existence is never mentioned or alluded to. Also, unlike the Trinity, and Green Arrow, there'd be no differences between the 2 versions (i.e. Kal L vs. Kal El) and they'd never have met each other. Even Aquaman, who similarly had a late-minute All-Star Squadron appearance confirm he was on both Earths had anachronisms from the Golden Age that separate the two (like Atlantis being abandoned and Arthur being fully human).

What makes the idea he emigrated Earths interesting is that it must mean either his brother also emigrated with him, or he somehow met up with his family on his new Earth. If it's the former then that would mean Hal Jordan, Green Lantern actually has his roots in the same Earth Alan Scott is from, and if Larry and Martin never crossed over Earth-1's Green Lantern wouldn't be Hal. It would also mean Martin Jordan was from another universe and that just played nothing into Hal's life or story.

So what it probably is that Larry moved over by himself, then fathered Air Wave II and met up with Martin Jordan, discovering he was his brother in this universe. I guess Larry looked up his parents' counterparts and found out they had a son, Martin.

All this to say my fan theory is that Larry and Martin are multiversal counterparts to one another who see only each other as brothers. This would mean Hal and Hal are half brothers more than they are cousins. Otherwise this means nothing. Most of this lore was established in the 2 years before the universe was rebooted.

I guess the timeline is that sometime in the 60s Larry moved Earths, met teenage Kal El Superboy (quick maths: if Kal El is late 30s in 1985, he'd be a teenager in the 60s), started a family, died, then in the present day Air Wave II takes up the Golden Age mantle, just as his cousin/half-brother-from-another-universe did."

I’d like to give my own personal views of the movie.

You’re free to disagree with me on any points I am about to make, it’s also midnight rn so excuse shitty spellings or whatever lol


Right off the bat, this was barely a Justice League movie. It’s a trinity movie. Martian Manhunter straight up doesn’t exist until the last quarter of the film. 

So the film is mainly divided into 4 ‘acts’, act 1 followed Wonder Woman in the Wild West world with Jonah Hex and stuff, act 2 featured Batman having to fight this wizard whoever, act 3 had Superman in an early to mid 1900’s era figuring out white martian stuff, act 4 is the actual warworld stuff. The first 3 stories were almost completely separate, they showed hints of what’s going on and why it’s happening by letting you see that the trinity don’t remember their true identities, and that each story is followed with the same characters carrying over to the next story but their memories essentially rewritten to fit the setting. Okay, cool, we have that down, yet, nothing of warworld has any correlation to this. Until in Act 4 where it’s all revealed it was Martian Manhunter who was being forced by Mongul to cast these illusions for some reason? 

For a title that has “Warworld” in it it sure features almost absolutely nothing of it. This movie suffers similar issues as previous instalments (mainly talking about GL:BMP) most notably the severe mishandling of characters. 

Warworld nor Mongul was at all developed. If I had to guess, Mongul, who was supposed to be the big bad baddy final boss, had at most 3 minutes of screen time. He rambles about finding a key that’s hidden in the Martians or something so he could kill planets (I think), tortures MMH for a while and then gets his ass handed to him the moment Lobo betrays him and MMH becomes free. The movie also mentions how there’s apparently a lot of prisoners on Warworld but we literally never gets shown that, unless I was mistaken. Still, the actual Warworld is barely shown. It’s like they lost track after making 3 mini what-if stories that they went “oh shit this is a Warworld movie” and shoehorned it in. 

Now, personally, I thought the first 3 acts were alright. Not perfect, but on their own they were alright. There were attempts to make it all work, but unfortunately they were so little that it didn’t work. What got me most appalled was how unsatisfying and redundant MMH’s final sacrifice was. Mentioning the lack of development for Warworld again, his sacrifice meant absolutely nothing when we were never shown just how dangerous Warworld is. That’s a major issue in some of the tomorrowverse movies. The context and story is spoken to us, not shown. Mongul goes on about how dangerous Warworld is and that him getting that key would make him unstoppable or something. MMH talks about how Warworld’s multiversal travel would be dangerous but it’s all just spoken by the characters. We’re never shown how Warworld would affect other worlds, they just tell us oh yeah Warworld can multiversally travel and they got all these characters from other worlds and clones of them to keep up the illusions yet we’re never shown exactly how it happened. This same problem was visible in GL when Green Arrow only talked about how cool of a guy Hal was but the audience were never shown any interaction between them.

Honestly? The ending was seriously the biggest disappointment of the movie. Warworld fell flat, J’onn’s sacrifice meant nothing, trinity gets saved by fire hair lady (sorry I have no idea who that is 😭) and then a crisis story is teased. 

I think what could’ve made this movie better was to actually have Warworld span the entire movie. Make it apparent that Mongul is forcing Manhunter to do all this illusion and telepathy stuff so he could toy with the characters and make them fight for his enjoyment or something I don’t know. Have MMH actually be of significance not by making him scream, be in pain, tortured and give spoken word context and then fucking die (I am very salty about his death because of how unnecessary it was)  

Sincerely I very much wanted this movie to be good. I had been looking forward to it from the moment it was announced. I enjoyed Man of Tomorrow and Long Halloween and I always thought people were way too harsh on the tomorrowverse movies. Seriously would never have imagined it could’ve turned out possibly worse than Beware My Power.

Anyways I’m gonna sleep now bye bye"

A few thoughts on the Graduation Day comics): 

1. I'm excited to see where Nitida &amp; Dynastes (and other beetles) go from here. Jaime's still a kid and having a team (an alien race and a city) depend on him is gonna be interesting.
2. The Starfire &amp; Cyborg appearance was nice! I have a soft spot for the Titans and their own colleagues. I hope to see them crossover in their own series!
3. I remember Victoria Kord playing an antagonist/anti-hero so it's interesting what she'll do next.
4. Who is Black Condor ( sorry 😣 )

On a story-relative note, are there any titles or stories that talk about alien immigration? Jaime made a decision for the whole city and I know it's gonna be explored in the upcoming series but I'm interested in knowing if there were any other existing stories with this theme.

[Discussion] Never understood the Batcat ship,howisyesterday,0,https://i.redd.it/bzcssymmokdb1.jpg,1690056147.0,"As brief fling it makes a lot of sense. Batman likely feels the same thrill and excitement being with her as she does when she compulsively steals. With that, it makes their cat and mouse dynamic a sort of cute game between the two.

But here’s the thing. Batman is a devout vigilante who has dedicated everything in his life to upholding his strict moral code. He plans things meticulously and usually tries to purge any weaknesses or distraction. Typically swearing off relationships all together (until he inevitably makes a exception).

Catwoman is a criminal and will always be one. Their lifestyles and whole outlooks on life are entirely contradictory and do not mesh whatsoever. In it’s most charitable interpretation, it’s a forbidden fruit, “I can change him/her” type of toxic, self destructive relationship. I like them together but it’s a relationship that can never last (unless in the more campy Pre-Crisis). There was no doubt in my mind they were never going to marry.

Even Talia al Ghul makes more sense, because even though they still have that “forbidden fruit” dynamic, both of their lives and philosophies are more closely aligned because both of them (sometimes) are wholly dedicated to making the world a better place. Despite their disagreements and Talia’s ever increasing insanity, their core beliefs align closer than Batcat’s do. That ship will never work again in the main continuity of course, because she loves murder too much and even killed their son.

In closing, if you want a Bat-ship that can and should ideally work, watch Justice League and JLU. Wonderbat till I die, bitch."

1. **Superman: Birthright**: This modern retelling of Superman's origin is a great starting point to familiarize yourself with the iconic Man of Steel.
2. **Batman: Year One**: This classic storyline by Frank Miller delves into Batman's early days as a vigilante, providing a strong foundation for the Dark Knight's character.
3. **Wonder Woman: Year One**: Written by Greg Rucka, this story arc provides an excellent introduction to Wonder Woman's origins and her journey to becoming an Amazonian warrior.
4. **The Flash: The Dastardly Death of the Rogues!**: This story, written by Geoff Johns, offers an exciting and accessible entry into the world of the Flash, introducing you to the Scarlet Speedster.
5. **Aquaman: The Trench**: Written by Geoff Johns, this storyline showcases Aquaman's unique abilities and his place in the DC Universe.
6. **Green Lantern: Secret Origin**: Geoff Johns' take on Green Lantern's origin will introduce you to the cosmic side of DC and the Green Lantern Corps.
7. **Justice League: Origin**: This New 52 storyline by Geoff Johns assembles the core members of the Justice League and is an ideal introduction to the team.
8. **Batman: Hush**: This thrilling story by Jeph Loeb features numerous DC characters and showcases Batman's detective skills.
9. **Wonder Woman by Greg Rucka**: Consider reading Greg Rucka's run on Wonder Woman to get a deeper understanding of the character and her adventures.
10. **Flashpoint**: This event reshapes the DC Universe and leads to the New 52 continuity. It's an essential story to understand major changes in the DC Universe.
11. **Aquaman by Geoff Johns**: Continue with Geoff Johns' Aquaman run to explore the character further and experience his growth.
12. **Green Lantern by Geoff Johns**: Follow Geoff Johns' Green Lantern run for a comprehensive and epic journey through the Green Lantern mythos.
13. **Justice League: The Darkseid War**: This storyline by Geoff Johns is a must-read for Justice League fans and brings the team face-to-face with one of their most formidable foes.

I noticed it didn't include cyborg so I asked and it suggested:

 **Cyborg: Rebirth**: This one-shot comic serves as a great introduction to Cyborg's character and origins, written by John Semper Jr. and illustrated by Paul Pelletier.

Instead I wanted to Highlight the tragic undertone I feel whenever beetle and Max interact knowing what is going to happen and Ted’s fate. I wanted to highlight this story and panel in particular bc of the pure irony of beetle saving max’s life and max taking his. It was completely inadvertent at the time but this beautiful characterization makes Ted’s death in countdown to infinite crisis one of the saddest and most emotional deaths ever and made me cry immensely as he will forever be one of my favorite characters of all time and scenes like this highlight who Ted was brilliantly!"
"Realistically, Reverse Flash could never jerk off Barry at super speed.",maruhadapurpurine,1867,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/154y6lo/realistically_reverse_flash_could_never_jerk_off/,1689875864.0,"In the hypothetical scenario brought up by the famous meme ""It was me Barry"", Reverse Flash states he jerked Barry off so fast it led Barry to believe he nutted instantly at just a woman's touch.

This could actually never be done. For Barry to be jerked off fast enough as to not even notice it happening Reverse Flash would have to be moving at speeds beyond human perception. This means Barry's brain 🧠 would not even have time to process the stimulus it was receiving.

It would be impossible for Barry to go from completely flaccid to orgasming in less than half a second. Literally, the electric signals would not even have time to reach his brain and back to his weiner.

And there is a second problem. Friction burn. If Reverse Flash grabbed Barry's tiny pp and jerked it that fast it would simply rip the skin right off, or give Barry a terrible 3rd degree burn. Now, if he used lotion maybe that wouldn't happen? I'm no expert. Also, we know he wouldn't use his mouth 👄 because he specifically says he jerked Barry off, and not gave him a bj.

So that means Reverse Flash is actually lying. But why? He wants to help Barry not feel so bad about his premature ejaculation problem. Reverse Flash takes the blame for Barry's embarrassing moment to help his rival maintain the confidence he needs to keep doing what he does. Because what is the Reverse Flash without a Flash to reverse?"

This show is so much darker than I remember but holyyy its a good show. I think JLU is a bit more light hearted if I remember correctly. The episodes “A better world” parts 1 and 2 were INSANE! Not gonna spoil in case, but its basically the same vibe as Injustice, even though the episodes aired before the comic run. DC animated shows and movies never disappoint, even though some traumatized me as a kid lmao

Also - Batman TAS dropped on Netflix too, there goes my summer lmao"

The Newly Announced Outsiders Series Looks A Lot Like Planetary,KentuckyFriedSnake88,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1557h4d/the_newly_announced_outsiders_series_looks_a_lot/,1689897191.0,"So they just announced a new Outsiders book from Kelly and Lanzing, and it looks a lot like Planetary. 

For those who don't know, Planetary was a series from Warren Ellis and John Cassady on WildStorm that focused on three superpowered being acting as ""Archeologists of The Impossible."" It was pretty cool and is deserving of more praise that it gets now. 

Well, when DC announced the new Outsiders series, almost everything about it immediately reminded me of Planetary and I don't know if that's a coincidence or not. I don't know whether or not this is either A. an intended homage to Planetary, B. a backdoor to introduce Planetary into the DCU akin to Superman and The Authority, or C. I'm just seeing stuff. 

Here's the similarities I noticed.

They've described the new Outsiders book as a ""Super-archeology"" book, which sounds very familiar to the plot of Planetary. It all fits just a little too well.

There's been more of a push to bring back WildStorm properties at DC in one way or another, such as with The Authority and WildC.A.T.S. A Planetary Reunion doesn't seem too far out of the question.

Luke Fox is dressing almost exactly like Elijah Snow. Trenchcoat, shirt, vest, tie, slacks, and gloves just  like Elijah Snow. He's even wearing a white beanie over his hair, mimicking Elijah's own white hair color. 

Batwoman has a red and black color scheme like Jakita Wagner. This is a bit more likely to be coincidence.

The third person on the cover is holding what looks to be a drumstick a kin to The Drummer, the third member of Planetary. I don't know who this is and I usually wouldn't mind or care if it weren't for the previous two similarities. (EDIT: It's been confirmed that yes, this is a new version of The Drummer, so from that alone, I can guess all of this is intentional.)

They're standing on a PLANET in a pose similar to something from Planetary #1. 

Bleeding Cool have also made an article pointing out these similarities. [https://bleedingcool.com/comics/batwoman-batwing-lead-a-new-planetary-style-outsiders-comic-from-dc/](https://bleedingcool.com/comics/batwoman-batwing-lead-a-new-planetary-style-outsiders-comic-from-dc/)

Maybe I'm crazy or pointing out the obvious. Lemmino if I am. I am 90% convinced this is all intentional or at least a homage."

All of this has made me wonder. If you were living in the DC comics Universe as an average mook, or as some sort of specialist (engineer, scientist, fixer, cleaner, professional assassin etc.), and you have decided to make a living by working for criminals and villains which ones would you want to work for?

Just for an example let’s say you were living in Gotham. If you wanted to work for a villain the best ones to work for would be the Penguin and the Riddler since they are both the sanest villains/criminals in Gotham compared to the Joker and Two-face and they pay very well. The Penguin even offers his henchmen 401ks."

At the beginning, the origin of the company seemed a bit rush due to the fact that they sort of skimmed through the earlier years of the company, but that is just a minor nitpick since I understand that it is extremely complicated. It was nice how the history of the trinity seamlessly transitioned into one another. However, I do feel like some characters like the Green Lantern were kind of skipped over a little. His lore seems a bit overlooked too. All negatives aside, they handled DC’s place in the comic world with honesty and that’s what I really respect and look for in these documentaries. They treated Marvel with respect and allowed themselves to be seen as the somewhat inferior publisher in the 60s. It was depressing but history is history. One last thing, I wish they went over the DCAU in a bit more detail. I’m also surprised the 2003 Teen Titans show wasn’t mentioned nor their highly acclaimed animated movies. All in all, still a interesting tale of a legendary company."

Some from the 70s, some in the 80, 90s, etc. Then I thought why not something similar for DC productions? I've had this idea for a while, but got to thinking again after watching The Flash. What if, instead of being stingy with their characters as DC is want to do, they introduced various heroes and villains in their old shows, movies and serials? For example in Adventures of Superman instead of typical gangsters and generic mad scientists they actually had Lex Luthor, Bizarro, Brainiac, etc. Or it had cameos from other Superheroes such as Flash, Batman, Wonder Woman, hell let's go crazy and include Green Lantern! With all that in mind who do you think would they have cast back then?

"A very small nitpick with what I've seen of ""My Adventures with Superman""",ImaFireSquid,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/154hdzb/a_very_small_nitpick_with_what_ive_seen_of_my/,1689829140.0,"Don't get me wrong, the ""All American Superhero"" show is... not very available outside of America so I've successfully managed to see clips.

My one issue is that, in the oooold comics, Lois had a thing for Superman and Clark and thought she was in the middle of a love triangle since both seemed to have a thing for her. Definitely my favorite love triangle since it's carried by Lois having a clear type and Clark being sort of bad at acting when he puts on the superman suit. Altogether, just high quality pointless drama.

This iteration of Lois seems to prefer Clark to Superman, and I feel as though the opportunities for comedy where Lois struggles through the difficult choice between the same guy in two different costumes is lost."

I'm thinking that he isn't just adopted as another Robin, but is maybe a traitor to his parents who are eventually killed by those who hired them by tipping Bruce Wayne off about their assassination attempt. He doesn't become a Robin, let alone adopted by him, but does accept a job position with Henri Ducard and becomes trained in detective and hunting skills while training with specialized sabers (something between a rapier and a katana that I can think of; handles like a rapier, but cuts like a katana)."

but you also dont see Ivy going after the cultures that do care for the natural world
she goes after the capitalists, and the overconsumers and except you can clearly see that Ivy's hatred of humanity and wanting to wipe it out, has exceptions and is really only targeted towards the people who harm nature, it's just poor dialogue choices that mean she doesn't talk about the specifics.""

Is this true?"

I’ve always been curious and I don’t know if the comics have explored this or not, so I thought I’d ask!"

Superman Vol. 6 #7 = 850 Issues of Superman,Valeyard_X,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/1546p7t/superman_vol_6_7_850_issues_of_superman/,1689800229.0,"Since Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash have returned with their Legacy Numbering (Marvel-style), I’ve been hoping poor Superman would follow one day.  It looks like with Superman (Vol. 6) #7, DC might have a chance to make things right.

Looking at the SIX volumes of the Superman title published since 1939, October’s Superman #7 will be his 850th issue.  This does not take into account series like Superman: Son of Kal-El.  This only includes the ongoing Superman title.

Superman (Vol. 1) = 423 

Superman (Vol. 2) = 291 (The
title returned to Legacy Numbering with #650 in 2006 going from #226 to #650 during One Year Later. It ended with #714.) 

Superman (Vol. 3) = 52 

Superman (Vol. 4) = 45 

Superman (Vol. 5) = 32 

Superman (Vol. 6) = 7

Total = 850

Batman (Vol. 3) #85 would have been #850 but DC passed over it (finally catching up with #900).  Both Wonder Woman and The Flash got their #750s restored back in 2020.  I know DC probably won’t revert Superman’s numbering to #850 but maybe a snazzy celebration issue and an additional “Legacy Numbering” shout out is in order."
