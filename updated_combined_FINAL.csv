agents shield managed run whole seasons even with the threat cancellation staying overall consistent quality and ending strong not mention excellent writing and characters the fact that did multiple concepts before the larger mcu and did better time travel what storyline wanda visions themed intros shapeshifters and who can you trust storylines etc the fact that does great worldbuilding for the larger mcu and the creators and writers behind actually care about the source material and the comics and honoring them unlike the secret invasion director writer who didn even read the comic because something that really annoyes the fact that when aos originally was airing people were shitting the show saying that didnt connect enough the movies and nobody the movies referenced wasnt canon and that when the disney plus shows came out would finally get some proper marvel content that was actually good and high quality like the movies and connected and had consequences the larger mcu but then what happened that not only aos better show then most not all the disney plus shows far also has the most references and interconnectivety the larger mcu then most them and the disney plus shows feel largely disconnected inconsequensal the larger mcu with movie referencing them besides loki guess and wandavison sort but then the writer for mom didnt even watch wandavision care about case and point think time look back and realize that had good back the day with aos and daredevil netflix etc and that these disney plus shows ain the end all all quality marvel content our screens and that aos especially should respected for what and what achieved ",1

start saying thought was probably decent and entertaining show and totally understand that many people will certainly enjoy despite all the vocal uproar critics see this sub and don’ want imagine other places online was however quite disappointed because had very high expectations for that show that had excellent premise nick fury facing infiltration alien shapeshifters earth spy thriller genre without ton superheroes being involved the end found the plot very predictable and quite silly but what disappointed the most was the pointless killing potentially very good characters maria hill… killed fridged summarily for pure shock value the end the first episode what waste good character and excellent actress talos… killed fridged summarily the end the 4th episode did die offscreen between episode and without even proper final word all the great and interesting build uphe had until then ’ say was arguably the most likeable and “good” character the show with varra gets suddenly put the ground and incinerated like his body ’ add these raava aka “skrhodey” summarily killed fury with another head shot did get one those half the episodes not many will probably miss him but think great missed opportunity not have had him survive and become main antagonist against the real rhodey armor wars great challenge for cheadle play both characters and since apparently rhodey had been replaced for long time possibly before infinity war would have been interesting see both them interact with the avengers what little left them anyway skrhodey could have genuinely shared real camaraderie with his fellow avengers despite his being secretly alien impostor while fighting among them against great threats protect earth and gotten liking being considered and loved hero the population nod what happens the original thunderbolts comics with supervillains posing superheroes and liking the other hand the end civil war the real rhodey was only really friend with the now deceased tony stark and would have extremely antagonistic relation with hawkeye antman bucky and sam now captain america considering fought them and put some them jail and might still believe the sokovia accords are still justified all the more now than superhumans can skrulls impersonators prime possible recruit for the thunderbolts least good opportunity have interesting arc for him but the saddest assassination for not physical killing but the character assassination the main protagonist nick fury himself fans loved him for being the supreme master spy and strategist always steps ahead everyone shown sad shadow husk his former self supposedly trying fix his past mistakes without outside help because “’ personal” but never has any real plan except the dumbest one the finale mean giving the harvest the genocidal psychopath gravik and the inexperienced and probably still unreliable ’iah give them the power one the most powerful beings the universe really understand the writers opted show washed out old soldier with ptsd after was traumatized the blip could really happen the strongest ones would have gone for that least the end the show fury was shown have overcome his depression and fatigue and regained his confidence and efficiency has zero accountability and apparently zero remorse for his past mistakes “sorry tried but knew just could not kept lying and using you for own benefit” and keeps doing till the end not really trying fix the resulting damage and apparently prefers stay space saber away from the masses and the messes caused supervise his protective planetary shield project shows little empathy the death his supposed friends and allies hill talos worse all the “heroic” albeit not always very ethical nick fury thought knew and loved practically depicted total fraud not outright villain the show both talos and gravik accuse him having used “pimped” them for years his dirty work for him taking him the position power now has and letting him get all the credit without him doing anything for them return something cannot and does not deny these secret skrull operatives really were his dispensable equivalent the comics’ lmds all these years and like true ruthless and amoral warlord did not hesitate send children assassinate other people with family and kids psychologically marking them for life and causing them become psychopaths these revelations make him much closer the “darker grey” almost evil version fury get the ultimates comics and some may consider not that far from dreykov and his black widow program ’ sure some viewers will least find some redeeming value his love affair with varra but never was good husband her and looks was going abandon her again she had not been the one come and join him the end ’ certain the movie the marvels will give back much more positive and enjoyable characterization fury… ,1

thousands upon thousands fans but victor von doom could the next iron man what does that mean means ’ character capable reigniting passion and excitement for the genre the kind character you can mention borrow for the plot for nearly any story you want tell over decade and have people invested enough that they will show even ten years after the first appearance get that anticipated conclusion for the mcu has run from 2008 the present day took years tell the infinity saga but they’ obviously not burdened the same slow production and financial limitations they may have had before for reference the multiverse saga scheduled for release over year span with likely close double the content assuming that timeline maintained for the mutant saga that gives them years from 2019 2033 finish the current planned version the mcu from 2008 2033 years and those were full iron man while ’ now over years removed his last appearance… with exactly years left the projected timeline enough room for exactly one more iron man… the three most well known teams from the comics are the men fantastic four and the avengers this why the men and fantastic four were getting standalone movies before the avengers were even conceived live action when does the mcu start pulling out the big guns again ’ been getting ever growing team avengers and there’ still room explore there honestly ’ possible that the avengers recur through all sagas but ’ also possible see the avengers less seldom start give those other teams the spotlight that they deserve moving forward with that mind… the fantastic four planned before both avengers films the multiverse saga phase six 2025 probably one the earlier films the phase same director from wandavision who did good job with the family dynamic ’ excited ’ seen lot people saying doom shouldn’ the main antagonist for that film tend agree hasn’ worked for the last two fantastic fours let’ give rest but … victor and reed’ rivalry runs deep enough that you want ever present you want either see why happens have already exist you see happen then you have take away from another villain put larger focus doom movie that ’ not the main antagonist the optimal option have the hatred already exist the time fantastic four releases 2025 how you that you introduce victor first maybe even get like him bit first feel and understand his hatred toward reed when ’ explained victor introduced before early phase but ’ currently early phase the clock ticking that leaves with the one phase establish victor von doom optimal setting loki showed that the mcu aren’ afraid tease big bad the shows long they get their own film appearance that leaves with range projects consisting armor wars ’ definitely this bad boy movie without title character age where people say the mcu directionless the only reason this hasn’ been straight cancelled yet because ’ probably avengers level event terms number heroes and their power and giving doom’ name would spoil just have idea when ’ actually getting released which tells ’ less important where this story told ’ probably not the beginning doom’ story just part the lead his role secret wars the marvels unlikely too space oriented and ’ start earth and grow outward like the mcu did deadpool would disrespectful honestly captain america brave new world possible though ’ take sam easily probably not could teased here though red hulk and the leader plenty for sam dealing with already thunderbolts very possible the thunderbolts might the team ’ allowed watch lose just make somebody else seem more intimidating powerful could see them taking trip latveria blade unlikely though not impossible ’ not sure how the paranormal and magic fit together here but doom probably isn’ debuting here… loki unlikely though not impossible imagine they stick with the focus kang this one since still haven’ gotten enough him and ’ where loki last left off echo doom has better things than fight deaf chick ironheart very possible they are associated the comics and they both connect through the pursuit vibranium show that seems like ’ about iron man’ legacy the film ffh called heart iron being replaced the actual next iron man… doctor doom also futures magic user and… doom does that too perfect agatha coven chaos unlikely though not impossible does focus magic but ’ likely agatha has other demons face wouldn’ expect doom debut here any means but appearance wouldn’ impossible daredevil born again doom has better things than beat blind guy really just… armor wars ironheart the thunderbolts and course… secret invasion the show have one episode left and happens air next week the skrulls are villain the fantastic four franchise and would make sense connect them with the further via doctor doom while

disclaimer there are long stretches releases that are either chronological some varied form release order but you will also find films from one phase another that are miles away from their chronology release order said this subjective order and not looking butt heads over personal viewing list not consider this order the best version anything nearly righteous simply wanted find the best thematic pleasurable viewing order but also find the best way get through this gargantuan gaggle superhero films all that being said everybody the ceremony about begin block avengers assemble naturally had start somewhere the only film missing from this block the incredible hulk for many tired and amply talked about reasons captain america the first avenger obviously gonna start with the first avenger cap and his humble beginnings the super serum our first and definitely not our last taste the tesseract the red skull looking you incredible future cameo bucky barnes and the first the trilogy their friendship fun and solid way start prefer watch only last frame and omit the post credit scene cap waking present times only treat this first film almost like one off adventure and keep little mystery for first time viewers who might use this order iron man the prodigal son this follows the course pretty much this whole block logically and chronologically there infinity stones but there the first appearance our trusty nick fury vestiges the ten rings rhodey albeit played just the once terrence howard pepper and happy yada yada and forth shortly after skip the incredible hulk for myriad reasons explained later and instead dive into iron man playing these back back one the only instances this mcu order but very rewarding especially given the immensity tony importance that gets such depth set complimentary origin stories rhodey gets his war machine armor justin hammer enters interesting way and our grand heroine the black widow gets her entrance into the mcu with nick fury along for the ride this film trio with tfa and iron man also creates rich tableau howard stark and his relationship with his son seen from multiple angles with multiple revelations that echo far into the future thor our first entry into the great marvel cosmos meet the god thunder comes age age what 1400 something there loki the warriors three odin and frigga also meet hawkeye for the first time round out five our six avengers and set the stage for the cosmic threats that will plague our heroes the coming years coincidentally this films post credit feeds right into the avengers just ragnarok will lead right into infinity war few blocks from now post credit had date the first real change made placing this captain america first avenger post credits scene here personally just chopped off digital copy and made its own little clip before our first big team begins gets cap back the periphery these stories given its been three films since last saw him also gets nick fury back into the fold after his absence thor the avengers must seen this damn movie times theaters and know wasn the only one honest hadn even seen maybe two the solo stories before saw avengers which gotta say was fun got watch them retrospectively anywho get two infinity stones and loki sent the errand thanos who has quietly been waiting and hunting for the lot what follows the ripple effect the battle new york and plants the seeds for the evolving threats and general paranoia that makes the second block lastly given that skip the incredible hulk mostly for the recast like think this film bruce banner real introduction the mcu and thoroughly enjoy the symmetry iron man giving black widow thor giving hawkeye and this film finally giving our last avenger for now block suit armor around the world this shorter block removed thor the dark world sure would gotten tease the collector but meet him like the guardians shortly and the aether isn really big deal say the tesseract loki scepter replaced its cosmic journey with captain marvel this one radical placement courtesy the pegasus order and aligned with its rationale being the jumping off point for nick fury avengers initiative treat this like retrospective for the first block whilst also jumping out into space after the battle new york and loki capture get some skrulls who will play big part only for miles away get look back nick fury before known any cosmic threats set his and carol relationship for last minute cavalry call years down the line and gives more coulson respectively functions flashback over the whole first act the infinity saga while also introducing the kree korath and ronan the accuser who all play big part guardians the galaxy continue our journey through the cosmos and meet our motley crew space holes and following captain marvel see quick time jumped reappearance the kree korath ronan meet the collector proper the guardians without the thor post credit spoil get the power stone the nova corps ravagers and yondu also get strange parallel with captain marvel before with main characters peter quill and carol danvers both being humans abducted from earth finally journey back earth for iron man which find tony many other redditors have pointed out having had plenty time sink into his ptsd and build his massive array suits his erratic behavior and fear after the wormhole new york are part proliferation cosmic activity that began thor and sees tony finally succumb that fear avengers aou get more rhodey and happy course and fun slightly harrowing callback iron man with yinsen better known the man who would come rescue tony the afghan cave years later infinity stones here nick fury and very few ties the rest the mcu save for ten rings reference years away captain america the winter soldier the quintessential spy movie the marvel universe never has been done better this film has little with anything cosmic but rather paves the way for the cap bucky tony storyline and begins the cap and tony arcs getting cap out his company man boots see jasper sitwell again after seeing him the first avengers film more black widow doing her thing with nick fury his old tricks meet falcon and thus begin three film streak his appearances while getting some end credits teasing age ultron and civil war which are both around the corner hell even get mention stephen strange but many point out doesn behoove one put doctor strange before this film make work just doesn avengers age ultron the end this block and with plenty meat its bones think this film represented the final sentiments lighter mcu and paved the way for the more serious and conscious characters would get the era civil war get much too spader ultron ulysses klaue vibranium and ties wakanda strucker and the mind stone experiments thor helps birth the vision scarlet witch joins see the full rage hulk and iron man the hulkbuster which see again someday this also the last appearance hulk until ragnarok for gods sake while the focus may have been the infinity stones least peripherally this phase they about fade into the background for little while block civil war this whole block stems from combination the first and second avengers and comes hilt civil war where begins ripple outwards touching multiple characters and influencing multiple storylines ant man pegasus order dictated this film while good phase closer the way the mcu intended made for good block opener here introducing quantum realm and all its possibilities the upcoming infinity war continues the falcon trend blends scott into the existing avengers universe and establishes history between hank pym and the stark family reality right where should sandwiched between age ultron and civil war and begins shift from more tony centered world towards cap and the fallout the dissolution the avengers for now the end the film teases civil war through one luis big monologues only rip scene directly from for the post credit captain america civil war here have one helluva stepping point for the avengers thus far and more than few characters join the fray zemo gets bucky out hiding and begins the fall our heroic team and wakanda gets paid off from teases age ultron black panther seeks his revenge and ant man continues his entry into the avengers take dour sort turn for few films with the governments the world seeking accountability from our heroes for their past actions and therein the story becomes richer and sets long belated origin for black widow picks immediately after civil war and features the last appearance william hurt thunderbolt ross joe russo said one the brothers avengers commentaries that the mcu doesn have move forward linearly anymore and this film our evidence doesn give much but get black widow sister eventual replacement along with red guardian and taskmaster who are due part the upcoming thunderbolts seems like brainer have here only redeem the ridiculousness its phase release omit the post credit due its time jump vying use later instead black panther takes place week after the events civil war and finds challa subject civil strife his own country due his father assassination meet everett ross and get the last foreseeable appearance ulysses klaue the film teased one two civil war post credits scenes along with spider man homecoming chronological order less spider man homecoming set three months and two films after civil war peter has had plenty time marinate the aftermath those events and build his teen angst also the first what and others seen call the mentorship trilogy where bolstered iron man and not quite accustomed being friendly neighborhood spider man the scope the film appropriately small and doesn web out much into the mcu ant man the wasp here another radical placement though whole phase away from its release and chronology believe the right film end this block with especially considering also subject the ripple effect civil war hope and hank are still reeling from scott involvement with captain america his use the suit and that hostility very present this film making seem more proximal civil war there not whole lot time line reference wise besides the whole ankle bracelet two years deal that makes odd place here and for the post credit but that easily omitted also somehow fitting put here given that ant man started this phase and keeps the more lighthearted feeling homecoming after three serious films row block infinity war saw put another custom viewing order the beginning the war end the cosmos least half anyway there few films out chronology but otherwise this block follows pretty linear plot towards its epic conclusion here the infinity stones return play and the journey leans back into space again guardians the galaxy vol pegasus order was either this one and was the fence about for while used have back block two double feature with the first guardians because ain just fun but then got thinking how long they actually absent until now and just too damn long staggering their second adventure which yes takes place only months after their first film here performs similar function the tfa post credit just before avengers putting the guardians back our periphery not long before they appear infinity war something can said for leaving double feature where belongs chronologically that their appearance more surprise but personally like opening this block with fun film that reincludes the team before the darker themes and either way that shot ego blue car and that 1980 title card all fresh enter block helluva way set mood doctor strange though his name mentioned earlier here our first appearance the soon sorcerer supreme string films that feature him return the quantum realm after learning some about the two ant man films and get our first taste magic well get some setups that will paid off strange second feature and the appearance the final known infinity stone just time for the mad titan truly begin his hunt for them for being connected relevant macguffins and locations this film pretty isolate from the rest the mcu and functions more origin story than contribution the infinity storyline thor ragnarok with our little dose magic from doctor strange and his neat little cameo here lead back into the cosmos for last trip with thor and loki here have the final appearance the warriors three and odin the introduction valkyrie and korg and reunion with our hulk after his last appearance all the way back age ultron more mjolnir more asgard and just loki looks though going turn over new leaf for real for real the post credits scene takes right into the dark embrace avengers infinity war destiny arrives board set pieces are moving and all the stones are play the culmination over films spanning years not much else said post credit scott gets trapped ripped from ant man the wasp this scene can little janky considering how much time has passed since scott and the gang agreed help ava ghost sort out her phasing problem for them just getting those particles for her now but well thanos has snapped his fingers and scott gets stuck while post credit where fury captain marvel responds fury page and scene the wake thanos snap was meant seen between the two avengers films looks and fits well here— right where should avengers endgame should played two parter despite both films hefty length the way the films were released meant had wait and seethe the aftermath infinity war and half our heroes disappearing before our eyes the beauty watching home don have sit for year you could throw ant man the wasp captain marvel between but recommend watching them back back feels like the epic should feel like block part the journey the ending this block has quite few strange placements but service good intentions overall mostly goodbyes from several characters very much denouement the infinity saga wandavision forever for those who don know which might majority there cut hour compressed fan edit wandavision out there called wandavision forever which use myself own personal order while you can watch the season version instead wandavision forever has been recut and therefore begins with monica rambeau sudden return following the avenger snap all works nice thread back into the mcu post endgame she one the outside forces attempting solve the westview anamoly begin from her pov and find our way back wanda through the television broadcast while maintaining the mystery this strange location darcy lewis from the thor films comes back witchcraft brought the forefront via agatha harkness and the seeds for wanda despotic turn mom are planted she gains possession the darkhold spider man far from home this one was supposed the epilogue the infinity saga taking place right after endgame think that far too premature and doesn give peter nearly enough time ruminate mourn his mentor with wandavision helping widen the gap free venture closer the burgeoning multiverse also get some skrull presence for the first time since block two and far out callback characters from civil war all the way back iron man also get jake fantastic turn one spidey most cerebral foes and honestly really believe mysterio dead spider man way home given ffh bomb shell post credits scene where mysterio reveals peter identity the world only seems right make the two spidey films double feature pick right where left off and close out peter mentorship trilogy get more doc strange and wong and see peter ready take new york solo the friendly neighborhood spider man team hawkeye supposedly hawkeye and spider man nwh occur around the same time whether that true not neat follow nwh with another story set new york and given just saw our friend matt murdock aka daredevil nwh neat follow with kingpin first appearance immediately after also get the introduction yelena belova and with the team hawkeye fanedit even get that black widow post credit scene where valentina sic yelena hawkeye believing him her sister killer like wandavision use fanedit called team hawkeye remember guys just google search away continue streamlining the viewing experience and gearing towards film plus there lot fat trimmed this show which consider among the weaker the disney outings still good see where one our final legacy avengers after the events endgame doctor strange the multiverse madness this one supposed follow nwh damn near right after chronologically however placing after hawkeye give doctor strange little time marinate like peter did ffh when the block started strange recalls america chavez recently there was incident with spider man which makes sound like nwh didn just happen yesterday also this gives the events wandavision more weight when strange shows ask wanda for her help black panther wakanda forever marvel phase this film the closer but damn sad affair for own personal enjoyment could not end this particular block with such depressing tale while true represents the beginning new era for wakanda and the black panther also represents the passing great hero and one our late joiner from the civil war era like doctor strange ant man doesn web out into the larger universe too much save for introducing riri williams aka ironheart and namor just somehow feels right put this ending beginning chapter the black panther saga somewhere near the end this block only follow with guardians the galaxy vol another radical placement know but given that the phases have been skewed this point favor the new block arrangements placed gotg3 here simply for enjoyment and closure this block called part the journey the ending and mean really— what better way could there end but saying goodbye the freakin only didn use freakin guardians the galaxy known them for nearly decade chronologically bit farther along compared and mom but there little the way references the larger mcu though course takes place after infinity war and endgame and broaches concepts the multiverse the variant gamora also fun place here this block represents some the final notes the infinity saga and ushers into the multiverse new frontier first teased seven years ago doctor strange block six the circle opens this where things get hinky there are projects from both phase and and they are largely not faithful marvel release order chronology this where completely take the wheel and order things primarily based own preference for the time being loki chronologically for the most part this takes place before the spidey double feature block and contributes strange spell going haywire however given now putting both feet into the multiverse feels only right open with loki and its crazy conclusion which will introduce our new ultra villain this block named for the final moments season one where that beautiful closed ring time opens and plunges the multiverse into chaos still get chills from the line see you soon eternals though would liked have opened the block with this one because feels like mythical reset the mcu not one favorite mcu entries and until its ties the larger universe are revealed remains very bloated and disjointed origin story theories have speculated connection shang chi think the two interchangeable terms order moon knight not much say about this one except put somewhere here this block which represents new ground floor origin stories and new entries remnants the infinity saga out chronology here but there not much tell how connected not connected the multiverse once again this show represented story stretched its limits and would likely been better feature film shang chi the legend the ten rings this one also origin story with only loose ties the larger multiverse including small bit trevor slattery from iron man its post credit scene lets know shang being brought into the mcu large but not exactly how when its supposed connection with eternals may provide some answers time falcon the winter soldier even though technically goes before shang chi the timeline this show pretty fuzzy and more inclined place closer captain america brave new world that comes out next year there plenty connections the past especially the civil war era with zemo agent carter even the wakandans mostly just placed here add break between shang chi and ant man ant man the wasp quantumania scott and the gang are back and the stakes are larger than either the first ant man films for better worse finally meet the man the myth the conqueror kang this film enforces the multiverse saga moving forward pays off loose threads from ant man the wasp shines new light janet van dyne and introduces scott daughter costume stature brutally wasted but hey the bright side get cool tease loki season and the council kangs for good measure this block additionally takes new slightly shaky character being primarily composed origin stories and set ups for new batch avengers marvel though its not favorite project smaller ant man sized origin film might sufficed believe sandwiching this show next even near the upcoming the marvels coming november might prove the most logical placement given the end credits scene closing for now that all got remember guys this own viewing list not chronological not pegasus little bit both things get added and this new forking timeline becomes clearer likely come back make amendments and placements ciao for now ,1

gotta frank here never thought could this lazy was meant write this december last year when was suddenly struck with mountains work got all the work done but just couldn’ set aside enough time energy write this with the recent events the comics kamala khan having just died spider man comic side character somehow the anger from asm was enough get start this addition kamala being revived not surprised lol and her revival being written iman vellani has had laughing for days and now really wanted this post done course you feel differently about this show than then all means feel free share your own thoughts also obvious spoiler warning end foreword with the marvels the horizon and with internet conversation the marvel series reigniting wanted write this post show appreciation for the herculean love and care from the creators that went unnoticed for this show before get started ’ already written posts for episode utm source shareutm medium ios apputm name iossmf and how both are also fantastic their own right episode ’ general reception from gathering the public’ opinion this episode was generally love hate response some appreciated that the show took time shed light historical event that often gets left out the world’ history books while others have mentioned waste time for history lesson they didn’ want relevance the “karachi” arc when originally saw the episode had similar thoughts well ”’ the most narratively packed part the show’ plot and they decided completely omit kamala for half how does the partition let alone kamala’ time karachi fit into the show whole ” all felt like story from another season but some point september last year suddenly clicked when looked further into generational trauma the mcu see characters that through all kinds trauma some physical like when tony had car battery strapped his heart keep him alive while could emotional such when tony found out bucky killed his parents but rarely see generational trauma where the physical and emotional hardships the parent manifest unpredictably the child this the case with kamala’ family sana survived the partition physically traumatic experience but new trauma manifested muneeba emotionally response sana repeatedly showing lack normalcy like being mother for muneeba but how can sana that when she has the unresolved trauma her own mother dying while she was young and now muneeba having left sana karachi inadvertently causes kamala develop adverse reaction where she struggling bond with muneeba which what see early the show promise this all connects back the rest the show bear with now know the partition integral part kamala’ family history but the show dedicated most this episode where kamala wasn’ even present how can show this this question stumped for months and for the longest time wasn’ sure the answer sequence integral the show’ narrative beats and themes that the protagonist doesn’ even need present for then clearly there something inside this “flash back time travel” sequence that either narratively thematically relevant the show turns out that partition sequence episode the cornerstone for entire story the show let explain why now see the show aisha and hassan move pakistan out fear regardless who wants kill them they’ afraid dying one the earliest questions had was ”how you even survive such horrific event ” after all anywhere between 200 000 million people died the span hours and even after the initial bloodshed there would still loose families either side who would’ likely been marked for death tried answer this question expanded out this how you leave behind everything you’ ever known live foreign land gotta say that hits quite close home and more importantly ’ bang for the show’ themes for lot families who “survived” assuming atleast one member lives this would very real question for them and ’ bet you the answer has something with blending and not doing anything out the ordinary doing anything that isn’ normal will attract fear and you’ seen and the survivors have learnt fear attracts death result what think really happened was that while sana and others survived that mentality “ normal don’ attract fear” stayed with her immediate community which influenced muneeba leave sana who wasn’ being “normal” aka mother once again that same mentality what influenced kamala’ desire fit and normal the western community and while the “ normal don’ attract fear” approach allowed sana survive the partition that same mentality tearing her family apart addition start episode with aisha running from british soldier and result see her try blend afterwards what’ important here that trying blend isn’ what allowed her foster beautiful family was opening hassan and showing love that did this what kamala’ arc does the show learning that not being normal okay and showing love and courage the face fear which will see the dodc she able overcome her family’ generational trauma and actually bond with them way she couldn’ before and the funniest part that she did with the power love seriously episode all about that defense the clandestines until this point you’ probably noticed that haven’ mentioned the clandestines that’ fair but they’ also important this whole thing the clandestines aren’ good villains and massive fan this show have problem saying this… because they’ not villains sure they’ antagonistic force against kamala but they have non villainous motive which get home lot folks have judged them evil since najma said that they don’ care what happens kamala’ world one hand that evil the other hand ’ not like the world did them any favours just imagine being the run for your entire life stuck different world different form obviously lot their backstory was cut out but for the themes the show ’ not particularly important understand why they did the clandestines are cautionary tale family who were consumed fear fear that has driven nearly all their motives and result ’ caused them drift apart mostly via death but also through abandonment the point where only najma left front the portal the scene that follows next one the most heavily discussed moments the episode and honestly deserves its own post but ’ try best this moment kamala pleads with najma using her newfound knowledge her family’ history not talk with fear but with love instead she tried stop najma from denying kamran family this girl who got chased around najma and her crew for episodes straight refused show fear even after knowing najma killed her great grandmother and instead focused the fact that najma was making similar mistake leaving kamran behind thematic level this works but the issue that kamala learnt this lesson too late and was unable save najma after all borders whether not they are inter dimensional are always drawn blood thus episode becomes sort test see just what kamala has learnt since episode essentially najma sacrificed herself close the border between dimensions and gave her “noor” energy kamran that can protect himself can say this for certain since kamala confirms this kamran episode however that energy new and unstable kamran makes him stand out even more public thus attracting fear and extension the dodc all honesty this part could’ been conveyed more clearly but given the rocky development this show ’ glad got conveyed all regardless there’ much more just this episode that could talk about like the opening title sequence being history reel contrasting kamala’ imagination earlier the show how the radio aisha and hassan listen authentic radio from 1947 even how the transmission the radio intercuts with aisha’ words convey very different message this show completely packed the chimney with details and references that the likes new rockstars and screencrush will never find but ’ beyond saddened see the reception that this show got over the last year hope that three posts the most controversial episodes marvel provide even bit insight into why genuinely love this show ,1

Some of my controversial MCU opinions,canIgetamcchickenpls,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1501rmk/some_of_my_controversial_mcu_opinions/,1689394837.0, wanda gets too much hate feel like lot villains see wanda more villain than tortured soul know anybody can both but feel like with wanda lot her actions don’ deserve the amount criticism that they the biggest criticism that see about the westview incident which will admit one her worst actions but the same time also feel like people misunderstand wanda had mental breakdown and created the hex accident when she broke down and was trying release her grief and anguish doing her powers got stronger and manifested her thoughts reality because her powers are linked her emotions and her intense grief and anguish took physical form result there’ also the matter about her taking the entire town hostage which true but ’ more complicated than that she manifested her perfect life she had vision she had her kids and they lived the perfect community and was lot manage shown the halloween episode wandavision whatever wanda wasn’ focusing closer the boundaries the hex ceased function feel like this played part the reason why she didn’ notice that she was harming the people westview she was more focused creating the perfect life and appearing happy and have everybody else seem happy she seemingly was she couldn’ use her telepathic powers sense how the other people felt that’ why when vision called her out yes she was denial but she also was unable sense any negative feelings from the people who appeared seemingly happy even she willed them appear that way because her attention was mainly diverted maintaining her own perfect life yes that selfish but imagine being her position where after losing one many people you loved all sudden everything you’ ever wanted was just there and you finally had control over your life would you even question not mention that she stated few times that she did not know how any started she truly did not know what was going except for the fact that she had vision back they have family they are happy and she finally had control plus when she finally realized that she actually was hurting the people she let them immediately ’ not saying what she did wasn’ wrong but don’ think should thinking that this particular incident was her being malicious evil also see people criticize her actions mom she was corrupted the darkhold she wasn’ acting her own free will the darkhold has always turned the people who read into murderous psychopaths agatha morgan from runaways you still consider that canon and the people aos you still consider that canon and has always gave them reason keep reading for most people was power knowledge but for her was one the things that she held dear her heart her children who are fact real considering that they exist throughout the multiverse and just because they’ created from magic doesn’ make them any less living conscious just like how vision and ultron are conscious even though they are robots even monica confirmed that they are fact real even though seemed like she did she really didn’ have any free will control which why also don’ think that mom necessarily ruined her character development because she wasn’ necessarily character the whole movie until the end there’ also her actions lagos honestly don’ understand how people can blame her for what happened with the bomb lagos civil war she obviously wasn’ trying throw the explosion into building full people she made the split second decision try and contain powerful explosion and she was trying get away from everyone then was too much contain and got loose she was moving then based her reaction she obviously didn’ mean and was horrified what happened honestly don’ understand how people could look her bad light after that she was trying save lives plus were blame her for that why don’ people blame steve well steve was literally holding crossbones when pulled the trigger and wanda was like feet away how did wanda see before steve also can paint wanda bad person for something that was clearly mistake why can’ the same for tony and bruce after they created ultron which killed thousands not millions people but shouldn’ because was mistake the end the day that situation was nobody’ fault besides the guy who actually set off the bomb tony caused lot problems and was not heroic make him out now think this definitely most controversial hot take but depending how you look tony created lot problems and there’ few villains who had tony play some part their origins not even just ultron mysterio was quentin beck stark employee who created revolutionary holographic technology which tony renamed discredited him and used self therapy machine when quentin called him out and tony fired him wanda and pietro were children when army dropped stark missile into their home killing their parents and leaving them with tons trauma those are just the villains actually blame tony for not even including zemo not mention him causing the division avengers know cap played role too but all started when tony tried force everyone sign something they weren’ comfortable with over situation that caused and locked away the ones that didn’ not mention that felt guilty over the ultron incident but didn’ lock himself away that prison along with everybody else and actually take accountability not mention that was devoted fighting against his teammates that blackmailed child into fighting for him but other then those incidents don’ want hold the ultron incident against him because the end the day was just really bad accident that wasn’ even completely his fault captain marvel gets too much hate honestly don’ understand why people dislike captain marvel much think most the hate comes from people not liking brie larson but don’ understand why she gets much hate well ’ also seen people complain about her not having much personality but think she has little personality she probably didn’ her movie mainly due the fact that she was brainwashed and had her memory wiped soldier for the kree but even then thought that she was like tough kind and stubborn tomboy honest opinion she has just much personality the mcu heroes wouldn’ even consider her movie the worst the mcu but then again love almost all them but will say that think that black widow should’ been the first female led mcu movie and not captain marvel people were way too critical she hulk before came out let know you guys’ thoughts,1

mention borrow for the plot for nearly any story you want tell over decade and have people invested enough that they will show even ten years after the first appearance get that anticipated conclusion for the mcu has run from 2008 the present day took years tell the infinity saga but they’ obviously not burdened the same slow production and financial limitations they may have had before for reference the multiverse saga scheduled for release over year span with likely close double the content assuming that timeline maintained for the mutant saga that gives them years from 2019 2033 finish the current planned version the mcu from 2008 2033 years and those were full iron man while ’ now over years removed his last appearance… with exactly years left the projected timeline enough room for exactly one more iron man… the three most well known teams from the comics are the men fantastic four and the avengers this why the men and fantastic four were getting standalone movies before the avengers were even conceived live action when does the mcu start pulling out the big guns again ’ been getting ever growing team avengers and there’ still room explore there honestly ’ possible that the avengers recur through all sagas but ’ also possible see the avengers less seldom start give those other teams the spotlight that they deserve moving forward with that mind… the fantastic four planned before both avengers films the multiverse saga phase six 2025 probably one the earlier films the phase same director from wandavision who did good job with the family dynamic ’

Preferred Watch Method,colddeaddrummer,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151j32t/preferred_watch_method/,1689545046.0, preface for those who are looking for the chronological pegasus order ahead and google something more accurate this very personal subjective list but thought might intrigue those out there looking reformat their mcu order just take look this unprecedentedly massive scope films and television through new lense warned this list not entire not fully comprehensive and intended for the most streamlined experience the films with less attention being paid television does not include the outer mcu now defunct projects such the defender verse netflix cloak and dagger inhumans the spider venom verse agents shield any the one shots film television show may missing this avoid too much excess baggage from film television that doesn contribute much either the infinity saga the now burgeoning multiverse saga the structure the structure this new order based loosely the pegasus order once again just google and such the films are divided into respective blocks cordon them off from one another make for more digestible viewing and separate them thematically similar way marvel phases however there are more blocks than there are current phases less films each block and each given custom name because well just cause wanted give them cool names final disclaimer there are long stretches releases that are either chronological some varied form release order but you will also find films from one phase another that are miles away from their chronology release order said this subjective order and not looking butt heads over personal viewing list not consider this order the best version anything nearly righteous simply wanted find the best thematic pleasurable viewing order but also find the best way get through this gargantuan gaggle superhero films all that being said everybody the ceremony about begin block avengers assemble naturally had start somewhere the only film missing from this block the incredible hulk for many tired and amply talked about reasons captain america the first avenger obviously gonna start with the first avenger cap and his humble beginnings the super serum our first and definitely not our last taste the tesseract the red skull looking you incredible future cameo bucky barnes and the first the trilogy their friendship fun and solid way start prefer watch only last frame and omit the post credit scene cap waking present times only treat this first film almost like one off adventure and keep little mystery for first time viewers who might use this order iron man the prodigal son this follows the course pretty much this whole block logically and chronologically there infinity stones but there the first appearance our trusty nick fury vestiges the ten rings rhodey albeit played just the once terrence howard pepper and happy yada yada and forth shortly after skip the incredible hulk for myriad reasons explained later and instead dive into iron man playing these back back one the only instances this mcu order but very rewarding especially given the immensity tony importance that gets such depth set complimentary origin stories rhodey gets his war machine armor justin hammer enters interesting way and our grand heroine the black widow gets her entrance into the mcu with nick fury along for the ride this film trio with tfa and iron man also creates rich tableau howard stark and his relationship with his son seen from multiple angles with multiple revelations that echo far into the future thor our first entry into the great marvel cosmos meet the god thunder comes age age what 1400 something there loki the warriors three odin and frigga also meet hawkeye for the first time round out five our six avengers and set the stage for the cosmic threats that will plague our heroes the coming years coincidentally this films post credit feeds right into the avengers just ragnarok will lead right into infinity war few blocks from now post credit had date the first real change made placing this captain america first avenger post credits scene here personally just chopped off digital copy and made its own little clip before our first big team begins gets cap back the periphery these stories given its been three films since last saw him also gets nick fury back into the fold after his absence thor the avengers must seen this damn movie times theaters and know wasn the only one honest hadn even seen maybe two the solo stories before saw avengers which gotta say was fun got watch them retrospectively anywho get two infinity stones and loki sent the errand thanos who has quietly been waiting and hunting for the lot what follows the ripple effect the battle new york and plants the seeds for the evolving threats and general paranoia that makes the second block lastly given that skip the incredible hulk mostly for the recast like think this film bruce banner real introduction the mcu and thoroughly enjoy the symmetry iron man giving black widow thor giving hawkeye and this film finally giving our last avenger for now block suit armor around the world this shorter block removed thor the dark world sure would gotten tease the collector but meet him like the guardians shortly and the aether isn really big deal say the tesseract loki scepter replaced its cosmic journey with captain marvel this one radical placement courtesy the pegasus order and aligned with its rationale being the jumping off point for nick fury avengers initiative treat this like retrospective for the first block whilst also jumping out into space after the battle new york and loki capture get some skrulls who will play big part only for miles away get look back nick fury before known any cosmic threats set his and carol relationship for last minute cavalry call years down the line and gives more coulson respectively functions flashback over the whole first act the infinity saga while also introducing the kree korath and ronan the accuser who all play big part guardians the galaxy continue our journey through the cosmos and meet our motley crew space holes and following captain marvel see quick time jumped reappearance the kree korath ronan meet the collector proper the guardians without the thor post credit spoil get the power stone the nova corps ravagers and yondu also get strange parallel with captain marvel before with main characters peter quill and carol danvers both being humans abducted from earth finally journey back earth for iron man which find tony many other redditors have pointed out having had plenty time sink into his ptsd and build his massive array suits his erratic behavior and fear after the wormhole new york are part proliferation cosmic activity that began thor and sees tony finally succumb that fear avengers aou get more rhodey and happy course and fun slightly harrowing callback iron man with yinsen better known the man who would come rescue tony the afghan cave years later infinity stones here nick fury and very few ties the rest the mcu save for ten rings reference years away captain america the winter soldier the quintessential spy movie the marvel universe never has been done better this film has little with anything cosmic but rather paves the way for the cap bucky tony storyline and begins the cap and tony arcs getting cap out his company man boots see jasper sitwell again after seeing him the first avengers film more black widow doing her thing with nick fury his old tricks meet falcon and thus begin three film streak his appearances while getting some end credits teasing age ultron and civil war which are both around the corner hell even get mention stephen strange but many point out doesn behoove one put doctor strange before this film make work just doesn avengers age ultron the end this block and with plenty meat its bones think this film represented the final sentiments lighter mcu and paved the way for the more serious and conscious characters would get the era civil war get much too spader ultron ulysses klaue vibranium and ties wakanda strucker and the mind stone experiments thor helps birth the vision scarlet witch joins see the full rage hulk and iron man the hulkbuster which see again someday this also the last appearance hulk until ragnarok for gods sake while the focus may have been the infinity stones least peripherally this phase they about fade into the background for little while block civil war this whole block stems from combination the first and second avengers and comes hilt civil war where begins ripple outwards touching multiple characters and influencing multiple storylines ant man pegasus order dictated this film while good phase closer the way the mcu intended made for good block opener here introducing quantum realm and all its possibilities the upcoming infinity war continues the falcon trend blends scott into the existing avengers universe and establishes history between hank pym and the stark family reality right where should sandwiched between age ultron and civil war and begins shift from more tony centered world towards cap and the fallout the dissolution the avengers for now the end the film teases civil war through one luis big monologues only rip scene directly from for the post credit captain america civil war here have one helluva stepping point for the avengers thus far and more than few characters join the fray zemo gets bucky out hiding and begins the fall our heroic team and wakanda gets paid off from teases age ultron black panther seeks his revenge and ant man continues his entry into the avengers take dour sort turn for few films with the governments the world seeking accountability from our heroes for their past actions and therein the story becomes richer and sets long belated origin for black widow picks immediately after civil war and features the last appearance william hurt thunderbolt ross joe russo said one the brothers avengers commentaries that the mcu doesn have move forward linearly anymore and this film our evidence doesn give much but get black widow sister eventual replacement along with red guardian and taskmaster who are due part the upcoming thunderbolts seems like brainer have here only redeem the ridiculousness its phase release omit the post credit due its time jump vying use later instead black panther takes place week after the events civil war and finds challa subject civil strife his own country due his father assassination meet everett ross and get the last foreseeable appearance ulysses klaue the film teased one two civil war post credits scenes along with spider man homecoming chronological order less spider man homecoming set three months and two films after civil war peter has had plenty time marinate the aftermath those events and build his teen angst also the first what and others seen call the mentorship trilogy where bolstered iron man and not quite accustomed being friendly neighborhood spider man the scope the film appropriately small and doesn web out much into the mcu ant man the wasp here another radical placement though whole phase away from its release and chronology believe the right film end this block with especially considering also subject the ripple effect civil war hope and hank are still reeling from scott involvement with captain america his use the suit and that hostility very present this film making seem more proximal civil war there not whole lot time line reference wise besides the whole ankle bracelet two years deal that makes odd place here and for the post credit but that easily omitted also somehow fitting put here given that ant man started this phase and keeps the more lighthearted feeling homecoming after three serious films row block infinity war saw put another custom viewing order the beginning the war end the cosmos least half anyway there few films out chronology but otherwise this block follows pretty linear plot towards its epic conclusion here the infinity stones return play and the journey leans back into space again guardians the galaxy vol pegasus order was either this one and was the fence about for while used have back block two double feature with the first guardians because ain just fun but then got thinking how long they actually absent until now and just too damn long staggering their second adventure which yes takes place only months after their first film here performs similar function the tfa post credit just before avengers putting the guardians back our periphery not long before they appear infinity war something can said for leaving double feature where belongs chronologically that their appearance more surprise but personally like opening this block with fun film that reincludes the team before the darker themes and either way that shot ego blue car and that 1980 title card all fresh enter block helluva way set mood doctor strange though his name mentioned earlier here our first appearance the soon sorcerer supreme string films that feature him return the quantum realm after learning some about the two ant man films and get our first taste magic well get some setups that will paid off strange second feature and the appearance the final known infinity stone just time for the mad titan truly begin his hunt for them for being connected relevant macguffins and locations this film pretty isolate from the rest the mcu and functions more origin story than contribution the infinity storyline thor ragnarok with our little dose magic from doctor strange and his neat little cameo here lead back into the cosmos for last trip with thor and loki here have the final appearance the warriors three and odin the introduction valkyrie and korg and reunion with our hulk after his last appearance all the way back age ultron more mjolnir more asgard and just loki looks though going turn over new leaf for real for real the post credits scene takes right into the dark embrace avengers infinity war destiny arrives board set pieces are moving and all the stones are play the culmination over films spanning years not much else said post credit scott gets trapped ripped from ant man the wasp this scene can little janky considering how much time has passed since scott and the gang agreed help ava ghost sort out her phasing problem for them just getting those particles for her now but well thanos has snapped his fingers and scott gets stuck while post credit where fury captain marvel responds fury page and scene the wake thanos snap was meant seen between the two avengers films looks and fits well here— right where should avengers endgame should played two parter despite both films hefty length the way the films were released meant had wait and seethe the aftermath infinity war and half our heroes disappearing before our eyes the beauty watching home don have sit for year you could throw ant man the wasp captain marvel between but recommend watching them back back feels like the epic should feel like block part the journey the ending this block has quite few strange placements but service good intentions overall mostly goodbyes from several characters very much denouement the infinity saga wandavision forever for those who don know which might majority there cut hour compressed fan edit wandavision out there called wandavision forever which use myself own personal order while you can watch the season version instead wandavision forever has been recut and therefore begins with monica rambeau sudden return following the avenger snap all works nice thread back into the mcu post endgame she one the outside forces attempting solve the westview anamoly begin from her pov and find our way back wanda through the television broadcast while maintaining the mystery this strange location darcy lewis from the thor films comes back witchcraft brought the forefront via agatha harkness and the seeds for wanda despotic turn mom are planted she gains possession the darkhold spider man far from home this one was supposed the epilogue the infinity saga taking place right after endgame think that far too premature and doesn give peter nearly enough time ruminate mourn his mentor with wandavision helping widen the gap free venture closer the burgeoning multiverse also get some skrull presence for the first time since block two and far out callback characters from civil war all the way back iron man also get jake fantastic turn one spidey most cerebral foes and honestly really believe mysterio dead spider man way home given ffh bomb shell post credits scene where mysterio reveals peter identity the world only seems right make the two spidey films double feature pick right where left off and close out peter mentorship trilogy get more doc strange and wong and see peter ready take new york solo the friendly neighborhood spider man team hawkeye supposedly hawkeye and spider man nwh occur around the same time whether that true not neat follow nwh with another story set new york and given just saw our friend matt murdock aka daredevil nwh neat follow with kingpin first appearance immediately after also get the introduction yelena belova and with the team hawkeye fanedit even get that black widow post credit scene where valentina sic yelena hawkeye believing him her sister killer like wandavision use fanedit called team hawkeye remember guys just google search away continue streamlining the viewing experience and gearing towards film plus there lot fat trimmed this show which consider among the weaker the disney outings still good see where one our final legacy avengers after the events endgame doctor strange the multiverse madness this one supposed follow nwh damn near right after chronologically however placing after hawkeye give doctor strange little time marinate like peter did ffh when the block started strange recalls america chavez recently there was incident with spider man which makes sound like nwh didn just happen yesterday also this gives the events wandavision more weight when strange shows ask wanda for her help black panther wakanda forever marvel phase this film the closer but damn sad affair for own personal enjoyment could not end this particular block with such depressing tale while true represents the beginning new era for wakanda and the black panther also represents the passing great hero and one our late joiner from the civil war era like doctor strange ant man doesn web out into the larger universe too much save for introducing riri williams aka ironheart and namor just somehow feels right put this ending beginning chapter the black panther saga somewhere near the end this block only follow with guardians the galaxy vol another radical placement know but given that the phases have been skewed this point favor the new block arrangements placed gotg3 here simply for enjoyment and closure this block called part the journey the ending and mean really— what better way could there end but saying goodbye the freakin only didn use freakin guardians the galaxy known them for nearly decade chronologically bit farther along compared and mom but there little the way references the larger mcu though course takes place after infinity war and endgame and broaches concepts the multiverse the variant gamora also fun place here this block represents some the final notes the infinity saga and ushers into the multiverse new frontier first teased seven years ago doctor strange block six the circle opens this where things get hinky there are projects from both phase and and they are largely not faithful marvel release order chronology this where completely take the wheel and order things primarily based own preference for the time being loki chronologically for the most part this takes place before the spidey double feature block and contributes strange spell going haywire however given now putting both feet into the multiverse feels only right open with loki and its crazy conclusion which will introduce our new ultra villain this block named for the final moments season one where that beautiful closed ring time opens and plunges the multiverse into chaos still get chills from the line see you soon eternals though would liked have opened the block with this one because feels like mythical reset the mcu not one favorite mcu entries and until its ties the larger universe are revealed remains very bloated and disjointed origin story theories have speculated connection shang chi think the two interchangeable terms order moon knight not much say about this one except put somewhere here this block which represents new ground floor origin stories and new entries remnants the infinity saga out chronology here but there not much tell how connected not connected the multiverse once again this show represented story stretched its limits and would likely been better feature film shang chi the legend the ten rings this one also origin story with only loose ties the larger multiverse including small bit trevor slattery from iron man its post credit scene lets know shang being brought into the mcu large but not exactly how when its supposed connection with eternals may provide some answers time falcon the winter soldier even though technically goes before shang chi the timeline this show pretty fuzzy and more inclined place closer captain america brave new world that comes out next year there plenty connections the past especially the civil war era with zemo agent carter even the wakandans mostly just placed here add break between shang chi and ant man ant man the wasp quantumania scott and the gang are back and the stakes are larger than either the first ant man films for better worse finally meet the man the myth the conqueror kang this film enforces the multiverse saga moving forward pays off loose threads from ant man the wasp shines new light janet van dyne and introduces scott daughter costume stature brutally wasted but hey the bright side get cool tease loki season and the council kangs for good measure this block additionally takes new slightly shaky character being primarily composed origin stories and set ups for new batch avengers marvel though its not favorite project smaller ant man sized origin film might sufficed believe sandwiching this show next even near the upcoming the marvels coming november might prove the most logical placement given the end credits scene closing for now that all got remember guys this own viewing list not chronological not pegasus little bit both things get added and this new forking timeline becomes clearer likely come back make amendments and placements ciao for now ,1

gotta frank here never thought could this lazy was meant write this december last year when was suddenly struck with mountains work got all the work done but just couldn’ set aside enough time energy write this with the recent events the comics kamala khan having just died spider man comic side character somehow the anger from asm was enough get start this addition kamala being revived not surprised lol and her revival being written iman vellani has had laughing for days and now really wanted this post done course you feel differently about this show than then all means feel free share your own thoughts also obvious spoiler warning end foreword with the marvels the horizon and with internet conversation the marvel series reigniting wanted write this post show appreciation for the herculean love and care from the creators that went unnoticed for this show before get started ’ already written posts for episode utm source shareutm medium ios apputm name iossmf and how both are also fantastic their own right episode ’ general reception from gathering the public’ opinion this episode was generally love hate response some appreciated that the show took time shed light historical event that often gets left out the world’ history books while others have mentioned waste time for history lesson they didn’ want relevance the “karachi” arc when originally saw the episode had similar thoughts well ”’ the most narratively packed part the show’ plot and they decided completely omit kamala for half how does the partition let alone kamala’ time karachi fit into the show whole ” all felt like story from another season but some point september last year suddenly clicked when looked further into generational trauma the mcu see characters that through all kinds trauma some physical like when tony had car battery strapped his heart keep him alive while could emotional such when tony found out bucky killed his parents but rarely see generational trauma where the physical and emotional hardships the parent manifest unpredictably the child this the case with kamala’ family sana survived the partition physically traumatic experience but new trauma manifested muneeba emotionally response sana repeatedly showing lack normalcy like being mother for muneeba but how can sana that when she has the unresolved trauma her own mother dying while she was young and now muneeba having left sana karachi inadvertently causes kamala develop adverse reaction where she struggling bond with muneeba which what see early the show promise this all connects back the rest the show bear with now know the partition integral part kamala’ family history but the show dedicated most this episode where kamala wasn’ even present how can show this this question stumped for months and for the longest time wasn’ sure the answer sequence integral the show’ narrative beats and themes that the protagonist doesn’ even need present for then clearly there something inside this “flash back time travel” sequence that either narratively thematically relevant the show turns out that partition sequence episode the cornerstone for entire story the show let explain why now see the show aisha and hassan move pakistan out fear regardless who wants kill them they’ afraid dying one the earliest questions had was ”how you even survive such horrific event ” after all anywhere between 200 000 million people died the span hours and even after the initial bloodshed there would still loose families either side who would’ likely been marked for death tried answer this question expanded out this how you leave behind everything you’ ever known live foreign land gotta say that hits quite close home and more importantly ’ bang for the show’ themes for lot families who “survived” assuming atleast one member lives this would very real question for them and ’ bet you the answer has something with blending and not doing anything out the ordinary doing anything that isn’ normal will attract fear and you’ seen and the survivors have learnt fear attracts death result what think really happened was that while sana and others survived that mentality “ normal don’ attract fear” stayed with her immediate community which influenced muneeba leave sana who wasn’ being “normal” aka mother once again that same mentality what influenced kamala’ desire fit and normal the western community and while the “ normal don’ attract fear” approach allowed sana survive the partition that same mentality tearing her family apart addition start episode with aisha running from british soldier and result see her try blend afterwards what’ important here that trying blend isn’ what allowed her foster beautiful family was opening hassan and showing love that did this what kamala’ arc does the show learning that not being normal okay and showing love and courage the face fear which will see the dodc she able overcome her family’ generational trauma and actually bond with them way she couldn’ before and the funniest part that she did with the power love seriously episode all about that defense the clandestines until this point you’ probably noticed that haven’ mentioned the clandestines that’ fair but they’ also important this whole thing the clandestines aren’ good villains and massive fan this show have problem saying this… because they’ not villains sure they’ antagonistic force against kamala but they have non villainous motive which get home lot folks have judged them evil since najma said that they don’ care what happens kamala’ world one hand that evil the other hand ’ not like the world did them any favours just imagine being the run for your entire life stuck different world different form obviously lot their backstory was cut out but for the themes the show ’ not particularly important understand why they did the clandestines are cautionary tale family who were consumed fear fear that has driven nearly all their motives and result ’ caused them drift apart mostly via death but also through abandonment the point where only najma left front the portal the scene that follows next one the most heavily discussed moments the episode and honestly deserves its own post but ’ try best this moment kamala pleads with najma using her newfound knowledge her family’ history not talk with fear but with love instead she tried stop najma from denying kamran family this girl who got chased around najma and her crew for episodes straight refused show fear even after knowing najma killed her great grandmother and instead focused the fact that najma was making similar mistake leaving kamran behind thematic level this works but the issue that kamala learnt this lesson too late and was unable save najma after all borders whether not they are inter dimensional are always drawn blood thus episode becomes sort test see just what kamala has learnt since episode essentially najma sacrificed herself close the border between dimensions and gave her “noor” energy kamran that can protect himself can say this for certain since kamala confirms this kamran episode however that energy new and unstable kamran makes him stand out even more public thus attracting fear and extension the dodc all honesty this part could’ been conveyed more clearly but given the rocky development this show ’ glad got conveyed all regardless there’ much more just this episode that could talk about like the opening title sequence being history reel contrasting kamala’ imagination earlier the show how the radio aisha and hassan listen authentic radio from 1947 even how the transmission the radio intercuts with aisha’ words convey very different message this show completely packed the chimney with details and references that the likes new rockstars and screencrush will never find but ’ beyond saddened see the reception that this show got over the last year hope that three posts the most controversial episodes marvel provide even bit insight into why genuinely love this show ,1

like lot villains see wanda more villain than tortured soul know anybody can both but feel like with wanda lot her actions don’ deserve the amount criticism that they the biggest criticism that see about the westview incident which will admit one her worst actions but the same time also feel like people misunderstand wanda had mental breakdown and created the hex accident when she broke down and was trying release her grief and anguish doing her powers got stronger and manifested her thoughts reality because her powers are linked her emotions and her intense grief and anguish took physical form result there’ also the matter about her taking the entire town hostage which true but ’ more complicated than that she manifested her perfect life she had vision she had her kids and they lived the perfect community and was lot manage shown the halloween episode wandavision whatever wanda wasn’ focusing closer the boundaries the hex ceased function feel like this played part the reason why she didn’ notice that she was harming the people westview she was more focused creating the perfect life and appearing happy and have everybody else seem happy she seemingly was she couldn’ use her telepathic powers sense how the other people felt that’ why when vision called her out yes she was denial but she also was unable sense any negative feelings from the people who appeared seemingly happy even she willed them appear that way because her attention was mainly diverted maintaining her own perfect life yes that selfish but imagine being her position where after losing one many people you loved all sudden everything you’ ever wanted was just there and you finally had control over your life would you even question not mention that she stated few times that she did not know how any started she truly did not know what was going except for the fact that she had vision back they have family they are happy and she finally had control plus when she finally realized that she actually was hurting the people she let them immediately ’ not saying what she did wasn’ wrong but don’ think should thinking that this particular incident was her being malicious evil also see people criticize her actions mom she was corrupted the darkhold she wasn’ acting her own free will the darkhold has always turned the people who read into murderous psychopaths agatha morgan from runaways you still consider that canon and the people aos you still consider that canon and has always gave them reason keep reading for most people was power knowledge but for her was one the things that she held dear her heart her children who are fact real considering that they exist throughout the multiverse and just because they’ created from magic doesn’ make them any less living conscious just like how vision and ultron are conscious even though they are robots even monica confirmed that they are fact real even though seemed like she did she really didn’ have any free will control which why also don’ think that mom necessarily ruined her character development because she wasn’ necessarily character the whole movie until the end there’ also her actions lagos honestly don’ understand how people can blame her for what happened with the bomb lagos civil war she obviously wasn’ trying throw the explosion into building full people she made the split second decision try and contain powerful explosion and she was trying get away from everyone then was too much contain and got loose she was moving then based her reaction she obviously didn’ mean and was horrified what happened honestly don’ understand how people could look her bad light after that she was trying save lives plus were blame her for that why don’ people blame steve well steve was literally holding crossbones when pulled the trigger and wanda was like feet away how did wanda see before steve also can paint wanda bad person for something that was clearly mistake why can’ the same for tony and bruce after they created ultron which killed thousands not millions people but shouldn’ because was mistake the end the day that situation was nobody’ fault besides the guy who actually set off the bomb tony caused lot problems and was not heroic make him out now think this definitely most controversial hot take but depending how you look tony created lot problems and there’ few villains who had tony play some part their origins not even just ultron mysterio was quentin beck stark employee who created revolutionary holographic technology which tony renamed discredited him and used self therapy machine when quentin called him out and tony fired him wanda and pietro were children when army dropped stark missile into their home killing their parents and leaving them with tons trauma those are just the villains actually blame tony for not even including zemo not mention him causing the division avengers know cap played role too but all started when tony tried force everyone sign something they weren’ comfortable with over situation that caused and locked away the ones that didn’ not mention that felt guilty over the ultron incident but didn’ lock himself away that prison along with everybody else and actually take accountability not mention that was devoted fighting against his teammates that blackmailed child into fighting for him but other then those incidents don’ want hold the ultron incident against him because the end the day was just really bad accident that wasn’ even completely his fault captain marvel gets too much hate honestly don’ understand why people dislike captain marvel much think most the hate comes from people not liking brie larson but don’ understand why she gets much hate well ’ also seen people complain about her not having much personality but think she has little personality she probably didn’ her movie mainly due the fact that she was brainwashed and had her memory wiped soldier for the kree but even then thought that she was like tough kind and stubborn tomboy honest opinion she has just much personality the mcu heroes wouldn’ even consider her movie the worst the mcu but then again love almost all them but will say that think that black widow should’ been the first female led mcu movie and not captain marvel people were way too critical she hulk before came out let know you guys’ thoughts,1

episodes seems have been written with completely different idea what the rest the episodes had alert major secret invasion spoilers ahead imagine you all remember how those took slow showing more introspection the characters gave them and the story time breathe presenting gravik vengeful mastermind that immediately kills fury long time partner looked spy story somewhat like what got cap movies and was really excited then after the 3rd the episodes length starts reduce and some the foundations laid episodes seems have been completely forgotten for example what was the point showing how gravik took the command the secret skrull summit when never seen those skrulls with important roles the human society something help him after that episode why many plotlines and conflicts started open and then close that fast with proper resolution the 4th episode saw talos die the day after him and fury had whole conversation about how fury needed him was expecting see least the end the series nick take time pay show some respect his old friend close the circle maybe admitting that wouldn have made without his sacrifice but talos death seems only complicate things even more and all his efforts are wasted fury actions the last episode what was the point showing the mutiny the rebel skrulls against gravik you then have them all die offscreen for once when talos was going right talos had told iah that helping the humans against the rebel skrulls they would earn their gratitude that was his plan resolve his people problem and also what seems happen after news reports show how alien sacrificed while saving the president only blow all the finale when that idiot declares war all the aliens earth because you know they just remembered they need plot for avengers secret wars yeah about the declaration war does this include asgardians too because those are aliens too president don even get started about all those humans the skrull replaced coming out the area helped the military with zero radiation sickness and case you are going say that iodium pills don act like magical barrier from radioactivity they just protect your thyroid from and only small scale really starting think the director lying the interwiews how can you justificate similar plot holes with stuff like was too long can really believe this looks like that they where forced change the script they asked the people who had connect the plot the cutted sections the show too fast and the end the final result lacks lot explainations and shows major continuity errors and that why end with such plot holes discutible plot solutions like the dna more superhumans all stored inside single vial that suddenly becomes the mcguffin the show after episodes also why implanting alien dna should give you magic powers aren those learned only with training and meditation why iah shows have ghost powers she wasn the last battle why the hell there was ghost dna inside better stop here ultimately got cool spy story ending with cgi wrestling match that had nothing with the first episodes premise the only thing that came out good written this series the relationship between fury and vara but that wasn meant the main problem fury had face here instead with this montage get the impression fury prefered save his marriage instead maintaining the promise made his friend talos and the skrulls which understandable and underwhelming the same time would have definitely preferred this series had been the swan song samuel jackson character honestly would have liked more ending where was fury take the powers who then fought gravik the last breath emotinal fight against the orphan turned into monster and then dying for the radiation after saving all the others while iah should have been the one kill the false rodhey front the president show him not all skrulls are terrorists and fullfill her dad plan earning one the humanity most important pearson gratitude instead got series who sole purpose create another unecessarly powerful character and set the foundations for the next avengers movie seems that fury has involuted instead evolved and has lost lot the charisma had and don see real reason keep him around the francise with this ending,1

mention borrow for the plot for nearly any story you want tell over decade and have people invested enough that they will show even ten years after the first appearance get that anticipated conclusion for the mcu has run from 2008 the present day took years tell the infinity saga but they’ obviously not burdened the same slow production and financial limitations they may have had before for reference the multiverse saga scheduled for release over year span with likely close double the content assuming that timeline maintained for the mutant saga that gives them years from 2019 2033 finish the current planned version the mcu from 2008 2033 years and those were full iron man while ’ now over years removed his last appearance… with exactly years left the projected timeline enough

before the avengers were even conceived live action when does the mcu start pulling out the big guns again ’ been getting ever growing team avengers and there’ still room explore there honestly ’ possible that the avengers recur through all sagas but ’ also possible see the avengers less seldom start give those other teams the spotlight that they deserve moving forward with that mind… the

Preferred Watch Method,colddeaddrummer,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/151j32t/preferred_watch_method/,1689545046.0, preface for those who are looking for the chronological pegasus order ahead and google something more accurate this very personal subjective list but thought might intrigue those out there looking reformat their mcu order just take look this unprecedentedly massive scope films and television through new lense warned this list not entire not fully comprehensive and intended for the most streamlined experience the films with less attention being paid television does not include the outer mcu now defunct projects such the defender verse netflix cloak and dagger inhumans the spider venom verse agents shield any the one shots film television show may missing this avoid too much excess baggage from film television that doesn contribute much either the infinity saga the now burgeoning multiverse saga the structure the structure this new order based loosely the pegasus order once again just google and such the films are divided into respective blocks cordon them off from one another make for more digestible viewing and separate them thematically similar way marvel phases however there are more blocks than there are current phases less films each block and each given custom name because well just cause wanted give them cool names final disclaimer there are long stretches releases that are either chronological some varied form release order but you will also find films from one phase another that are miles away from their chronology release order said this subjective order and not looking butt heads over personal viewing list not consider this order the best version anything nearly righteous simply wanted find the best thematic pleasurable viewing order but also find the best way get through this gargantuan gaggle superhero films all that being said everybody the ceremony about begin block avengers assemble naturally had start somewhere the only film missing from this block the incredible hulk for many tired and amply talked about reasons captain america the first avenger obviously gonna start with the first avenger cap and his humble beginnings the super serum our first and definitely not our last taste the tesseract the red skull looking you incredible future cameo bucky barnes and the first the trilogy their friendship fun and solid way start prefer watch only last frame and omit the post credit scene cap waking present times only treat this first film almost like one off adventure and keep little mystery for first time viewers who might use this order iron man the prodigal son this follows the course pretty much this whole block logically and chronologically there infinity stones but there the first appearance our trusty nick fury vestiges the ten rings rhodey albeit played just the once terrence howard pepper and happy yada yada and forth shortly after skip the incredible hulk for myriad reasons explained later and instead dive into iron man playing these back back one the only instances this mcu order but very rewarding especially given the immensity tony importance that gets such depth set complimentary origin stories rhodey gets his war machine armor justin hammer enters interesting way and our grand heroine the black widow gets her entrance into the mcu with nick fury along for the ride this film trio with tfa and iron man also creates rich tableau howard stark and his relationship with his son seen from multiple angles with multiple revelations that echo far into the future thor our first entry into the great marvel cosmos meet the god thunder comes age age what 1400 something there loki the warriors three odin and frigga also meet hawkeye for the first time round out five our six avengers and set the stage for the cosmic threats that will plague our heroes the coming years coincidentally this films post credit feeds right into the avengers just ragnarok will lead right into infinity war few blocks from now post credit had date the first real change made placing this captain america first avenger post credits scene here personally just chopped off digital copy and made its own little clip before our first big team begins gets cap back the periphery these stories given its been three films since last saw him also gets nick fury back into the fold after his absence thor the avengers must seen this damn movie times theaters and know wasn the only one honest hadn even seen maybe two the solo stories before saw avengers which gotta say was fun got watch them retrospectively anywho get two infinity stones and loki sent the errand thanos who has quietly been waiting and hunting for the lot what follows the ripple effect the battle new york and plants the seeds for the evolving threats and general paranoia that makes the second block lastly given that skip the incredible hulk mostly for the recast like think this film bruce banner real introduction the mcu and thoroughly enjoy the symmetry iron man giving black widow thor giving hawkeye and this film finally giving our last avenger for now block suit armor around the world this shorter block removed thor the dark world sure would gotten tease the collector but meet him like the guardians shortly and the aether isn really big deal say the tesseract loki scepter replaced its cosmic journey with captain marvel this one radical placement courtesy the pegasus order and aligned with its rationale being the jumping off point for nick fury avengers initiative treat this like retrospective for the first block whilst also jumping out into space after the battle new york and loki capture get some skrulls who will play big part only for miles away get look back nick fury before known any cosmic threats set his and carol relationship for last minute cavalry call years down the line and gives more coulson respectively functions flashback over the whole first act the infinity saga while also introducing the kree korath and ronan the accuser who all play big part guardians the galaxy continue our journey through the cosmos and meet our motley crew space holes and following captain marvel see quick time jumped reappearance the kree korath ronan meet the collector proper the guardians without the thor post credit spoil get the power stone the nova corps ravagers and yondu also get strange parallel with captain marvel before with main characters peter quill and carol danvers both being humans abducted from earth finally journey back earth for iron man which find tony many other redditors have pointed out having had plenty time sink into his ptsd and build his massive array suits his erratic behavior and fear after the wormhole new york are part proliferation cosmic activity that began thor and sees tony finally succumb that fear avengers aou get more rhodey and happy course and fun slightly harrowing callback iron man with yinsen better known the man who would come rescue tony the afghan cave years later infinity stones here nick fury and very few ties the rest the mcu save for ten rings reference years away captain america the winter soldier the quintessential spy movie the marvel universe never has been done better this film has little with anything cosmic but rather paves the way for the cap bucky tony storyline and begins the cap and tony arcs getting cap out his company man boots see jasper sitwell again after seeing him the first avengers film more black widow doing her thing with nick fury his old tricks meet falcon and thus begin three film streak his appearances while getting some end credits teasing age ultron and civil war which are both around the corner hell even get mention stephen strange but many point out doesn behoove one put doctor strange before this film make work just doesn avengers age ultron the end this block and with plenty meat its bones think this film represented the final sentiments lighter mcu and paved the way for the more serious and conscious characters would get the era civil war get much too spader ultron ulysses klaue vibranium and ties wakanda strucker and the mind stone experiments thor helps birth the vision scarlet witch joins see the full rage hulk and iron man the hulkbuster which see again someday this also the last appearance hulk until ragnarok for gods sake while the focus may have been the infinity stones least peripherally this phase they about fade into the background for little while block civil war this whole block stems from combination the first and second avengers and comes hilt civil war where begins ripple outwards touching multiple characters and influencing multiple storylines ant man pegasus order dictated this film while good phase closer the way the mcu intended made for good block opener here introducing quantum realm and all its possibilities the upcoming infinity war continues the falcon trend blends scott into the existing avengers universe and establishes history between hank pym and the stark family reality right where should sandwiched between age ultron and civil war and begins shift from more tony centered world towards cap and the fallout the dissolution the avengers for now the end the film teases civil war through one luis big monologues only rip scene directly from for the post credit captain america civil war here have one helluva stepping point for the avengers thus far and more than few characters join the fray zemo gets bucky out hiding and begins the fall our heroic team and wakanda gets paid off from teases age ultron black panther seeks his revenge and ant man continues his entry into the avengers take dour sort turn for few films with the governments the world seeking accountability from our heroes for their past actions and therein the story becomes richer and sets long belated origin for black widow picks immediately after civil war and features the last appearance william hurt thunderbolt ross joe russo said one the brothers avengers commentaries that the mcu doesn have move forward linearly anymore and this film our evidence doesn give much but get black widow sister eventual replacement along with red guardian and taskmaster who are due part the upcoming thunderbolts seems like brainer have here only redeem the ridiculousness its phase release omit the post credit due its time jump vying use later instead black panther takes place week after the events civil war and finds challa subject civil strife his own country due his father assassination meet everett ross and get the last foreseeable appearance ulysses klaue the film teased one two civil war post credits scenes along with spider man homecoming chronological order less spider man homecoming set three months and two films after civil war peter has had plenty time marinate the aftermath those events and build his teen angst also the first what and others seen call the mentorship trilogy where bolstered iron man and not quite accustomed being friendly neighborhood spider man the scope the film appropriately small and doesn web out much into the mcu ant man the wasp here another radical placement though whole phase away from its release and chronology believe the right film end this block with especially considering also subject the ripple effect civil war hope and hank are still reeling from scott involvement with captain america his use the suit and that hostility very present this film making seem more proximal civil war there not whole lot time line reference wise besides the whole ankle bracelet two years deal that makes odd place here and for the post credit but that easily omitted also somehow fitting put here given that ant man started this phase and keeps the more lighthearted feeling homecoming after three serious films row block infinity war saw put another custom viewing order the beginning the war end the cosmos least half anyway there few films out chronology but otherwise this block follows pretty linear plot towards its epic conclusion here the infinity stones return play and the journey leans back into space again guardians the galaxy vol pegasus order was either this one and was the fence about for while used have back block two double feature with the first guardians because ain just fun but then got thinking how long they actually absent until now and just too damn long staggering their second adventure which yes takes place only months after their first film here performs similar function the tfa post credit just before avengers putting the guardians back our periphery not long before they appear infinity war something can said for leaving double feature where belongs chronologically that their appearance more surprise but personally like opening this block with fun film that reincludes the team before the darker themes and either way that shot ego blue car and that 1980 title card all fresh enter block helluva way set mood doctor strange though his name mentioned earlier here our first appearance the soon sorcerer supreme string films that feature him return the quantum realm after learning some about the two ant man films and get our first taste magic well get some setups that will paid off strange second feature and the appearance the final known infinity stone just time for the mad titan truly begin his hunt for them for being connected relevant macguffins and locations this film pretty isolate from the rest the mcu and functions more origin story than contribution the infinity storyline thor ragnarok with our little dose magic from doctor strange and his neat little cameo here lead back into the cosmos for last trip with thor and loki here have the final appearance the warriors three and odin the introduction valkyrie and korg and reunion with our hulk after his last appearance all the way back age ultron more mjolnir more asgard and just loki looks though going turn over new leaf for real for real the post credits scene takes right into the dark embrace avengers infinity war destiny arrives board set pieces are moving and all the stones are play the culmination over films spanning years not much else said post credit scott gets trapped ripped from ant man the wasp this scene can little janky considering how much time has passed since scott and the gang agreed help ava ghost sort out her phasing problem for them just getting those particles for her now but well thanos has snapped his fingers and scott gets stuck while post credit where fury captain marvel responds fury page and scene the wake thanos snap was meant seen between the two avengers films looks and fits well here— right where should avengers endgame should played two parter despite both films hefty length the way the films were released meant had wait and seethe the aftermath infinity war and half our heroes disappearing before our eyes the beauty watching home don have sit for year you could throw ant man the wasp captain marvel between but recommend watching them back back feels like the epic should feel like block part the journey the ending this block has quite few strange placements but service good intentions overall mostly goodbyes from several characters very much denouement the infinity saga wandavision forever for those who don know which might majority there cut hour compressed fan edit wandavision out there called wandavision forever which use myself own personal order while you can watch the season version instead wandavision forever has been recut and therefore begins with monica rambeau sudden return following the avenger snap all works nice thread back into the mcu post endgame she one the outside forces attempting solve the westview anamoly begin from her pov and find our way back wanda through the television broadcast while maintaining the mystery this strange location darcy lewis from the thor films comes back witchcraft brought the forefront via agatha harkness and the seeds for wanda despotic turn mom are planted she gains possession the darkhold spider man far from home this one was supposed the epilogue the infinity saga taking place right after endgame think that far too premature and doesn give peter nearly enough time ruminate mourn his mentor with wandavision helping widen the gap free venture closer the burgeoning multiverse also get some skrull presence for the first time since block two and far out callback characters from civil war all the way back iron man also get jake fantastic turn one spidey most cerebral foes and honestly really believe mysterio dead spider man way home given ffh bomb shell post credits scene where mysterio reveals peter identity the world only seems right make the two spidey films double feature pick right where left off and close out peter mentorship trilogy get more doc strange and wong and see peter ready take new york solo the friendly neighborhood spider man team hawkeye supposedly hawkeye and spider man nwh occur around the same time whether that true not neat follow nwh with another story set new york and given just saw our friend matt murdock aka daredevil nwh neat follow with kingpin first appearance immediately after also get the introduction yelena belova and with the team hawkeye fanedit even get that black widow post credit scene where valentina sic yelena hawkeye believing him her sister killer like wandavision use fanedit called team hawkeye remember guys just google search away continue streamlining the viewing experience and gearing towards film plus there lot fat trimmed this show which consider among the weaker the disney outings still good see where one our final legacy avengers after the events endgame doctor strange the multiverse madness this one supposed follow nwh damn near right after chronologically however placing after hawkeye give doctor strange little time marinate like peter did ffh when the block started strange recalls america chavez recently there was incident with spider man which makes sound like nwh didn just happen yesterday also this gives the events wandavision more weight when strange shows ask wanda for her help black panther wakanda forever marvel phase this film the closer but damn sad affair for own personal enjoyment could not end this particular block with such depressing tale while true represents the beginning new era for wakanda and the black panther also represents the passing great hero and one our late joiner from the civil war era like doctor strange ant man doesn web out into the larger universe too much save for introducing riri williams aka ironheart and namor just somehow feels right put this ending beginning chapter the black panther saga somewhere near the end this block only follow with guardians the galaxy vol another radical placement know but given that the phases have been skewed this point favor the new block arrangements placed gotg3 here simply for enjoyment and closure this block called part the journey the ending and mean really— what better way could there end but saying goodbye the freakin only didn use freakin guardians the galaxy known them for nearly decade chronologically bit farther along compared and mom but there little the way references the larger mcu though course takes place after infinity war and endgame and broaches concepts the multiverse the variant gamora also fun place here this block represents some the final notes the infinity saga and ushers into the multiverse new frontier first teased seven years ago doctor strange block six the circle opens this where things get hinky there are projects from both phase and and they are largely not faithful marvel release order chronology this where completely take the wheel and order things primarily based own preference for the time being loki chronologically for the most part this takes place before the spidey double feature block and contributes strange spell going haywire however given now putting both feet into the multiverse feels only right open with loki and its crazy conclusion which will introduce our new ultra villain this block named for the final moments season one where that beautiful closed ring time opens and plunges the multiverse into chaos still get chills from the line see you soon eternals though would liked have opened the block with this one because feels like mythical reset the mcu not one favorite mcu entries and until its ties the larger universe are revealed remains very bloated and disjointed origin story theories have speculated connection shang chi think the two interchangeable terms order moon knight not much say about this one except put somewhere here this block which represents new ground floor origin stories and new entries remnants the infinity saga out chronology here but there not much tell how connected not connected the multiverse once again this show represented story stretched its limits and would likely been better feature film shang chi the legend the ten rings this one also origin story with only loose ties the larger multiverse including small bit trevor slattery from iron man its post credit scene lets know shang being brought into the mcu large but not exactly how when its supposed connection with eternals may provide some answers time falcon the winter soldier even though technically goes before shang chi the timeline this show pretty fuzzy and more inclined place closer captain america brave new world that comes out next year there plenty connections the past especially the civil war era with zemo agent carter even the wakandans mostly just placed here add break between shang chi and ant man ant man the wasp quantumania scott and the gang are back and the stakes are larger than either the first ant man films for better worse finally meet the man the myth the conqueror kang this film enforces the multiverse saga moving forward pays off loose threads from ant man the wasp shines new light janet van dyne and introduces scott daughter costume stature brutally wasted but hey the bright side get cool tease loki season and the council kangs for good measure this block additionally takes new slightly shaky character being primarily composed origin stories and set ups for new batch avengers marvel though its not favorite project smaller ant man sized origin film might sufficed believe sandwiching this show next even near the upcoming the marvels coming november might prove the most logical placement given the end credits scene closing for now that all got remember guys this own viewing list not chronological not pegasus little bit both things get added and this new forking timeline becomes clearer likely come back make amendments and placements ciao for now ,1

gotta frank here never thought could this lazy was meant write this december last year when was suddenly struck with mountains work got all the work done but just couldn’ set aside enough time energy write this with the recent events the comics kamala khan having just died spider man comic side character somehow the anger from asm was enough get start this addition kamala being revived not surprised lol and her revival being written iman vellani has had laughing for days and now really wanted this post done course you feel differently about this show than then all means feel free share your own thoughts also obvious spoiler warning end foreword with the marvels the horizon and with internet conversation the marvel series reigniting wanted write this post show appreciation for the herculean love and care from the creators that went unnoticed for this show before get started ’ already written posts for episode utm source shareutm medium ios apputm name iossmf and how both are also fantastic their own right episode ’ general reception from gathering the public’ opinion this episode was generally love hate response some appreciated that the show took time shed light historical event that often gets left out the world’ history books while others have mentioned waste time for history lesson they didn’ want relevance the “karachi” arc when originally saw the episode had similar thoughts well ”’ the most narratively packed part the show’ plot and they decided completely omit kamala for half how does the partition let alone kamala’ time karachi fit into the show whole ” all felt like story from another season but some point september last year suddenly clicked when looked further into generational trauma the mcu see characters that through all kinds trauma some physical like when tony had car battery strapped his heart keep him alive while could emotional such when tony found out bucky killed his parents but rarely see generational trauma where the physical and emotional hardships the parent manifest unpredictably the child this the case with kamala’ family sana survived the partition physically traumatic experience but new trauma manifested muneeba emotionally response sana repeatedly showing lack normalcy like being mother for muneeba but how can sana that when she has the unresolved trauma her own mother dying while she was young and now muneeba having left sana karachi inadvertently causes kamala develop adverse reaction where she struggling bond with muneeba which what see early the show promise this all connects back the rest the show bear with now know the partition integral part kamala’ family history but the show dedicated most this episode where kamala wasn’ even present how can show this this question stumped for months and for the longest time wasn’ sure the answer sequence integral the show’ narrative beats and themes that the protagonist doesn’ even need present for then clearly there something inside this “flash back time travel” sequence that either narratively thematically relevant the show turns out that partition sequence episode the cornerstone for entire story the show let explain why now see the show aisha and hassan move pakistan out fear regardless who wants kill them they’ afraid dying one the earliest questions had was ”how you even survive such horrific event ” after all anywhere between 200 000 million people died the span hours and even after the initial bloodshed there would still loose families either side who would’ likely been marked for death tried answer this question expanded out this how you leave behind everything you’ ever known live foreign land gotta say that hits quite close home and more importantly ’ bang for the show’ themes for lot families who “survived” assuming atleast one member lives this would very real question for them and ’ bet you the answer has something with blending and not doing anything out the ordinary doing anything that isn’ normal will attract fear and you’ seen and the survivors have learnt fear attracts death result what think really happened was that while sana and others survived that mentality “ normal don’ attract fear” stayed with her immediate community which influenced muneeba leave sana who wasn’ being “normal” aka mother once again that same mentality what influenced kamala’ desire fit and normal the western community and while the “ normal don’ attract fear” approach allowed sana survive the partition that same mentality tearing her family apart addition start episode with aisha running from british soldier and result see her try blend afterwards what’ important here that trying blend isn’ what allowed her foster beautiful family was opening hassan and showing love that did this what kamala’ arc does the show learning that not being normal okay and showing love and courage the face fear which will see the dodc she able overcome her family’ generational trauma and actually bond with them way she couldn’ before and the funniest part that she did with the power love seriously episode all about that defense the clandestines until this point you’ probably noticed that haven’ mentioned the clandestines that’ fair but they’ also important this whole thing the clandestines aren’ good villains and massive fan this show have problem saying this… because they’ not villains sure they’ antagonistic force against kamala but they have non villainous motive which get home lot folks have judged them evil since najma said that they don’ care what happens kamala’ world one hand that evil the other hand ’ not like the world did them any favours just imagine being the run for your entire life stuck different world different form obviously lot their backstory was cut out but for the themes the show ’ not particularly important understand why they did the clandestines are cautionary tale family who were consumed fear fear that has driven nearly all their motives and result ’ caused them drift apart mostly via death but also through abandonment the point where only najma left front the portal the scene that follows next one the most heavily discussed moments the episode and honestly deserves its own post but ’ try best this moment kamala pleads with najma using her newfound knowledge her family’ history not talk with fear but with love instead she tried stop najma from denying kamran family this girl who got chased around najma and her crew for episodes straight refused show fear even after knowing najma killed her great grandmother and instead focused the fact that najma was making similar mistake leaving kamran behind thematic level this works but the issue that kamala learnt this lesson too late and was unable save najma after all borders whether not they are inter dimensional are always drawn blood thus episode becomes sort test see just what kamala has learnt since episode essentially najma sacrificed herself close the border between dimensions and gave her “noor” energy kamran that can protect himself can say this for certain since kamala confirms this kamran episode however that energy new and unstable kamran makes him stand out even more public thus attracting fear and extension the dodc all honesty this part could’ been conveyed more clearly but given the rocky development this show ’ glad got conveyed all regardless there’ much more just this episode that could talk about like the opening title sequence being history reel contrasting kamala’ imagination earlier the show how the radio aisha and hassan listen authentic radio from 1947 even how the transmission the radio intercuts with aisha’ words convey very different message this show completely packed the chimney with details and references that the likes new rockstars and screencrush will never find but ’ beyond saddened see the reception that this show got over the last year hope that three posts the most controversial episodes marvel provide even bit insight into why genuinely love this show ,1

post see someone had the same impressions had after the finale not critic expert just year old dude with passion for writing modern problems and cinema among other things apologize advance for possible errors the text not native speaker sorry for the long read think are all aware the protests going the hollywood industry these days and think this series has all the problems that the employees the industry itself complain about not just talking about using the for the opening but the obvious problems the plot least the plot saw this final montage any you noticed how the first two episodes seems have been written with completely different idea what the rest the episodes had alert major secret invasion spoilers ahead imagine you all remember how those took slow showing more introspection the characters gave them and the story time breathe presenting gravik vengeful mastermind that immediately kills fury long time partner looked spy story somewhat like what got cap movies and was really excited then after the 3rd the episodes length starts reduce and some the foundations laid episodes seems have been completely forgotten for example what was the point showing how gravik took the command the secret skrull summit when never seen those skrulls with important roles the human society something help him after that episode why many plotlines and conflicts started open and then close that fast with proper resolution the 4th episode saw talos die the day after him and fury had whole conversation about how fury needed him was expecting see least the end the series nick take time pay show some respect his old friend close the circle maybe admitting that wouldn have made without his sacrifice but talos death seems only complicate things even more and all his efforts are wasted fury actions the last episode what was the point showing the mutiny the rebel skrulls against gravik you then have them all die offscreen for once when talos was going right talos had told iah that helping the humans against the rebel skrulls they would earn their gratitude that was his plan resolve his people problem and also what seems happen after news reports show how alien sacrificed while saving the president only blow all the finale when that idiot declares war all the aliens earth because you know they just remembered they need plot for avengers secret wars yeah about the declaration war does this include asgardians too because those are aliens too president don even get started about all those humans the skrull replaced coming out the area helped the military with zero radiation sickness and case you are going say that iodium pills don act like magical barrier from radioactivity they just protect your thyroid from and only small scale really starting think the director lying the interwiews how can you justificate similar plot holes with stuff like was too long can really believe this looks like that they where forced change the script they asked the people who had connect the plot the cutted sections the show too fast and the end the final result lacks lot explainations and shows major continuity errors and that why end with such plot holes discutible plot solutions like the dna more superhumans all stored inside single vial that suddenly becomes the mcguffin the show after episodes also why implanting alien dna should give you magic powers aren those learned only with training and meditation why iah shows have ghost powers she wasn the last battle why the hell there was ghost dna inside better stop here ultimately got cool spy story ending with cgi wrestling match that had nothing with the first episodes premise the only thing that came out good written this series the relationship between fury and vara but that wasn meant the main problem fury had face here instead with this montage get the impression fury prefered save his marriage instead maintaining the promise made his friend talos and the skrulls which understandable and underwhelming the same time would have definitely preferred this series had been the swan song samuel jackson character honestly would have liked more ending where was fury take the powers who then fought gravik the last breath emotinal fight against the orphan turned into monster and then dying for the radiation after saving all the others while iah should have been the one kill the false rodhey front the president show him not all skrulls are terrorists and fullfill her dad plan earning one the humanity most important pearson gratitude instead got series who sole purpose create another unecessarly powerful character and set the foundations for the next avengers movie seems that fury has involuted instead evolved and has lost lot the charisma had and don see real reason keep him around the francise with this ending,1

horror and feature physical split the end avengers donald blake and thor except donald blake goes crazy and got killing spree everyone connected thor making him feel powerless this based off the thor
